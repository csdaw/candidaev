# candidaev

This repository contains the research compendium for our paper:

> Authors, (YYYY). _Title of paper_. Name of journal/book <https://doi.org/xxx/xxx>

The compendium includes all the data, code, and text associated with the publication.
It is structured as an R package to facilitate reproducilibity and distribution.
The principles and motivations behind using research compendiums for academic 
research is detailed in [Marwick et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986).

The R package [rrtools](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) was used in the 
production of this compendium.
