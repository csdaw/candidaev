  abstract = {Cells from all kingdoms of life produce extracellular vesicles (EVs). Their cargo is protected from the environment by the surrounding lipid bilayer. EVs from many organisms have been shown to function in cell\textendash{}cell communication, relaying signals that impact metazoan development, microbial quorum sensing, and pathogenic host\textendash{}microbe interactions. Here, we have investigated the production and functional activities of EVs in a surface-associated microbial community or biofilm of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Crowded communities like biofilms are a context in which EVs are likely to function. Biofilms are noteworthy because they are encased in an extracellular polymeric matrix and because biofilm cells exhibit extreme tolerance to antimicrobial compounds. We found that biofilm EVs are distinct from those produced by free-living planktonic cells and display strong parallels in composition to biofilm matrix material. The functions of biofilm EVs were delineated with a panel of mutants defective in orthologs of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) subunits, which are required for normal EV production in diverse eukaryotes. Most ESCRT-defective mutations caused reduced biofilm EV production, reduced matrix polysaccharide levels, and greatly increased sensitivity to the antifungal drug fluconazole. Matrix accumulation and drug hypersensitivity of ESCRT mutants were reversed by addition of wild-type (WT) biofilm EVs. Vesicle complementation showed that biofilm EV function derives from specific cargo proteins. Our studies indicate that C. albicans biofilm EVs have a pivotal role in matrix production and biofilm drug resistance. Biofilm matrix synthesis is a community enterprise; prior studies of mixed cell biofilms have demonstrated extracellular complementation. Therefore, EVs function not only in cell\textendash{}cell communication but also in the sharing of microbial community resources.},

  abstract = {Vesicular structures called microvesicles (MVs) that are shed from the surfaces of cancer cells are capable of transferring oncogenic cargo to recipient cancer cells, as well as to normal cells, sending mitogenic signals that greatly enhance tumor growth. Because MVs are stable in the circulation, they also may have a key role in secondary colonization and metastasis. Thus, understanding how MVs are generated could have important consequences for interfering with cancer progression. Here we report that the small GTPase RhoA triggers a specific signaling pathway essential for MV biogenesis in various human cancer cells. Inhibiting the activity of different proteins comprising this pathway blocks MV biogenesis in the donor cancer cells and prevents oncogenic transformation in cell culture as well as tumor growth in mice. Although RhoA has often been implicated in human cancer, these findings now highlight a previously unappreciated role for this GTPase in malignant transformation, and demonstrate that blocking MV biogenesis may offer novel approaches for interfering with malignant transformation.},

This protocol presents a complete description of the parameters used in MaxQuant, as well as of the configuration options of its integrated search engine, Andromeda. This protocol update describes an adaptation of an existing protocol that substantially modifies the technique. Important concepts of shotgun proteomics and their implementation in MaxQuant are briefly reviewed, including different quantification strategies and the control of false-discovery rates (FDRs), as well as the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs). The MaxQuant output tables, which contain information about quantification of proteins and PTMs, are explained in detail. Furthermore, we provide a short version of the workflow that is applicable to data sets with simple and standard experimental designs. The MaxQuant algorithms are efficiently parallelized on multiple processors and scale well from desktop computers to servers with many cores.

As morphogens, hydrophobic Wnt proteins exert their function over a distance to induce patterning and cell differentiation decisions. Recent studies have identified several factors that are required for the secretion of Wnt proteins; however, how Wnts travel in the extracellular space remains a largely unresolved question. Here we show that Wnts are secreted on exosomes both during Drosophila development and in human cells. We demonstrate that exosomes carry Wnts on their surface to induce Wnt signalling activity in target cells. Together with the cargo receptor Evi/WIs, Wnts are transported through endosomal compartments onto exosomes, a process that requires the R-SNARE Ykt6. Our study demonstrates an evolutionarily conserved functional role of extracellular vesicular transport of Wnt proteins.},

  abstract = {Summary Rho G-proteins are critical for polarized growth, yet little is known about the dynamics of their activation during fungal filamentous growth. We first investigated the roles of Rho1 and Rho2 during Candida albicans filamentous growth. Our results show that Rho1 is required for invasive filamentous growth and that Rho2 is not functionally redundant with Rho1. Using fluorescent reporters, we examined the dynamics of the active form of Rho1 and Cdc42 during initiation and maintenance of hyphal growth. Quantitative analyses indicated that the distribution, but not the level, of these active G-proteins is altered during initial polarization upon germ tube emergence. A comparison of the dynamics of these active G-proteins during budding and hyphal growth indicates that a higher concentration of active Cdc42 was recruited to the germ tube tip than to the bud tip. During hyphal elongation, active Cdc42 remained tightly restricted to the hyphal tip, whereas active Rho1 was broadly associated with the apex and subsequently recruited to the cell division site. Furthermore, our data suggest that phosphoinositide-bis-phosphates are critical to stabilize active Rho1 at the growth site. Together, our results point towards different regulation of Cdc42 and Rho1 activity during initiation and maintenance of filamentous growth.},

  abstract = {Protein quantification without isotopic labels has been a long-standing interest in the proteomics field. However, accurate and robust proteome-wide quantification with label-free approaches remains a challenge. We developed a new intensity determination and normalization procedure called MaxLFQ that is fully compatible with any peptide or protein separation prior to LC-MS analysis. Protein abundance profiles are assembled using the maximum possible information from MS signals, given that the presence of quantifiable peptides varies from sample to sample. For a benchmark dataset with two proteomes mixed at known ratios, we accurately detected the mixing ratio over the entire protein expression range, with greater precision for abundant proteins. The significance of individual label-free quantifications was obtained via a t test approach. For a second benchmark dataset, we accurately quantify fold changes over several orders of magnitude, a task that is challenging with label-based methods. MaxLFQ is a generic label-free quantification technology that is readily applicable to many biological questions; it is compatible with standard statistical analysis workflows, and it has been validated in many and diverse biological projects. Our algorithms can handle very large experiments of 500+ samples in a manageable computing time. It is implemented in the freely available MaxQuant computational proteomics platform and works completely seamlessly at the click of a button.},

This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

  abstract = {The fungal plasma membrane is critical for cell wall synthesis and other important processes including nutrient uptake, secretion, endocytosis, morphogenesis, and response to stress. To coordinate these diverse functions, the plasma membrane is organized into specialized compartments that vary in size, stability, and composition. One recently identified domain known as the Membrane Compartment of Can1 (MCC)/eisosome is distinctive in that it corresponds to a furrow-like invagination in the plasma membrane. MCC/eisosomes have been shown to be formed by the Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain proteins Lsp1 and Pil1 in a range of fungi. MCC/eisosome domains influence multiple cellular functions; but a very pronounced defect in cell wall synthesis has been observed for mutants with defects in MCC/eisosomes in some yeast species. For example, Candida albicans MCC/eisosome mutants display abnormal spatial regulation of cell wall synthesis, including large invaginations and altered chemical composition of the walls. Recent studies indicate that MCC/eisosomes affect cell wall synthesis in part by regulating the levels of the key regulatory lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2) in the plasma membrane. One general way MCC/eisosomes function is by acting as protected islands in the plasma membrane, since these domains are very stable. They also act as scaffolds to recruit \&gt;20 proteins. Genetic studies aimed at defining the function of the MCC/eisosome proteins have identified important roles in resistance to stress, such as resistance to oxidative stress mediated by the flavodoxin-like proteins Pst1, Pst2, Pst3 and Ycp4. Thus, MCC/eisosomes play multiple roles in plasma membrane organization that protect fungal cells from the environment.},

  abstract = {The last decade has seen a sharp increase in the number of scientific publications describing physiological and pathological functions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), a collective term covering various subtypes of cell-released, membranous structures, called exosomes, microvesicles, microparticles, ectosomes, oncosomes, apoptotic bodies, and many other names. However, specific issues arise when working with these entities, whose size and amount often make them difficult to obtain as relatively pure preparations, and to characterize properly. The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) proposed Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (``MISEV'') guidelines for the field in 2014. We now update these ``MISEV2014'' guidelines based on evolution of the collective knowledge in the last four years. An important point to consider is that ascribing a specific function to EVs in general, or to subtypes of EVs, requires reporting of specific information beyond mere description of function in a crude, potentially contaminated, and heterogeneous preparation. For example, claims that exosomes are endowed with exquisite and specific activities remain difficult to support experimentally, given our still limited knowledge of their specific molecular machineries of biogenesis and release, as compared with other biophysically similar EVs. The MISEV2018 guidelines include tables and outlines of suggested protocols and steps to follow to document specific EV-associated functional activities. Finally, a checklist is provided with summaries of key points.},

Candida albicans is the most prevalent fungal species of the human microbiota; this species asymptomatically colonizes many areas of the body, particularly the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts of healthy individuals. Alterations in host immunity, stress, resident microbiota, and other factors can lead to C. albicans overgrowth, causing a wide range of infections, from superficial mucosal to hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. To date, most studies of C. albicans have been carried out in suspension cultures; however, the medical impact of C. albicans (like that of many other microorganisms) depends on its ability to thrive as a biofilm, a closely packed community of cells. Biofilms are notorious for forming on implanted medical devices, including catheters, pacemakers, dentures, and prosthetic joints, which provide a surface and sanctuary for biofilm growth. C. albicans biofilms are intrinsically resistant to conventional antifungal therapeutics, the host immune system, and other environmental perturbations, making biofilm-based infections a significant clinical challenge. Here, we review our current knowledge of biofilms formed by C. albicans and closely related fungal species.},

  abstract = {Exosomes are small membrane vesicles, secreted by most cell types from multivesicular endosomes, and thought to play important roles in intercellular communications. Initially described in 1983, as specifically secreted by reticulocytes, exosomes became of interest for immunologists in 1996, when they were proposed to play a role in antigen presentation. More recently, the finding that exosomes carry genetic materials, mRNA and miRNA, has been a major breakthrough in the field, unveiling their capacity to vehicle genetic messages. It is now clear that not only immune cells but probably all cell types are able to secrete exosomes: their range of possible functions expands well beyond immunology to neurobiology, stem cell and tumor biology, and their use in clinical applications as biomarkers or as therapeutic tools is an extensive area of research. Despite intensive efforts to understand their functions, two issues remain to be solved in the future: (i) what are the physiological function(s) of exosomes in vivo and (ii) what are the relative contributions of exosomes and of other secreted membrane vesicles in these proposed functions? Here, we will focus on the current ideas on exosomes and immune responses, but also on their mechanisms of secretion and the use of this knowledge to elucidate the latter issue.},

Cells release heterogeneous vesicles of different sizes and intracellular origins, including small EVs formed inside endosomal compartments (i.e., exosomes) and EVs of various sizes budding from the plasma membrane. Specific markers for the analysis and isolation of different EV populations are missing, imposing important limitations to understanding EV functions. Here, EVs from human dendritic cells were first separated by their sedimentation speed, and then either by their behavior upon upward floatation into iodixanol gradients or by immuno-isolation. Extensive quantitative proteomic analysis allowing comparison of the isolated populations showed that several classically used exosome markers, like major histocompatibility complex, flotillin, and heat-shock 70-kDa proteins, are similarly present in all EVs. We identified proteins specifically enriched in small EVs, and define a set of five protein categories displaying different relative abundance in distinct EV populations. We demonstrate the presence of exosomal and nonexosomal subpopulations within small EVs, and propose their differential separation by immuno-isolation using either CD63, CD81, or CD9. Our work thus provides guidelines to define subtypes of EVs for future functional studies.},

Furthermore, it can handle data with arbitrarily high fragment mass accuracy, is able to assign and score complex patterns of post-translational modifications, such as highly phosphorylated peptides, and accommodates extremely large databases. The algorithms of Andromeda are provided. Andromeda can function independently or as an integrated search engine of the widely used MaxQuant computational proteomics platform and both are freely available at www.maxquant.org. The combination enables analysis of large data sets in a simple analysis workflow on a desktop computer. For searching individual spectra Andromeda is also accessible via a web server.

A combination of bioassays, behavioral studies and molecular analysis on O.~vulgaris and related species suggests that its proteome should contain a mixture of highly potent neurotoxins and degradative proteins. However, a lack of genomic and transcriptomic data has meant that the amino acid sequences of these proteins remain almost entirely unknown. To address this, we assembled the posterior salivary gland transcriptome of O.~vulgaris and combined it with high resolution mass spectrometry data from the posterior and anterior salivary glands of two adults, the posterior salivary glands of six paralarvae and the saliva from a single adult. We identified a total of 2810 protein groups from across this range of salivary tissues and age classes, including 84 with homology to known venom protein families. Additionally, we found 21 short secreted cysteine rich protein groups of which 12 were specific to cephalopods. By combining protein expression data with phylogenetic analysis we demonstrate that serine proteases expanded dramatically within the cephalopod lineage and that cephalopod specific proteins are strongly associated with the salivary apparatus.},

Exosomes are important regulators of the cellular niche, and their altered characteristics in many diseases, such as cancer, suggest their importance for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, and as drug delivery vehicles. Exosomes have been purified from biological fluids and in vitro cell cultures using a variety of strategies and techniques. In this chapter, we reveal the protocol and key insights into the isolation, purification and characterization of exosomes, distinct from shed microvesicles and apoptotic blebs. Using the colorectal cancer cell line LIM1863 as a cell model, a comprehensive evaluation of exosome isolation methods including ultracentrifugation (UC-Exos), OptiPrep\texttrademark{} density-based separation (DG-Exos), and immunoaffinity capture using anti-EpCAM-coated magnetic beads (IAC-Exos) were examined. All exosome isolation methodologies contained 40\textendash{}150 nm vesicles based on electron microscopy, and positive for exosome markers (Alix, TSG101, HSP70) based on immunoblotting. This protocol employed a proteomic profiling approach to characterize the protein composition of exosomes, and label-free spectral counting to evaluate the effectiveness of each method in exosome isolation. Based on the number of MS/MS spectra identified for exosome markers and proteins associated with their biogenesis, trafficking, and release, IAC-Exos was shown to be the most effective method to isolate exosomes. However, the use of density-based separation (DG-Exos) provides significant advantages for exosome isolation when the use of immunoaffinity capture is limited (due to antibody availability and suitability of exosome markers).},

Our report contains the first proteomic analysis of EVs in C. albicans and a comparative proteomic study of the soluble secreted proteins. With this purpose, cell-free culture supernatants from C. albicans were separated into EVs and EV-free supernatant and analyzed by LC\textendash{}MS/MS. A total of 96 proteins were identified including 75 and 61 proteins in EVs and EV-free supernatant, respectively. Out of these, 40 proteins were found in secretome by proteomic analysis for the first time. The soluble proteins were enriched in cell wall and secreted pathogenesis related proteins. Interestingly, more than 90\% of these EV-free supernatant proteins were classical secretory proteins with predicted N-terminal signal peptide, whereas all the leaderless proteins involved in metabolism, including some moonlighting proteins, or in the exocytosis and endocytosis process were exclusively cargo of the EVs. We propose a model of the different mechanisms used by C. albicans secreted proteins to reach the extracellular medium.

  abstract = {The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RHO1 gene encodes a low-molecular-weight GTPase. One of its recently identified functions is the regulation of beta-1,3-glucan synthase, which synthesizes the main component of the fungal cell wall (J. Drgonova et al., Science 272:277-279, 1996; T. Mazur and W. Baginsky, J. Biol. Chem. 271:14604-14609, 1996; and H. Qadota et al., Science 272:279-281, 1996). From the opportunistic pathogenic fungus Candida albicans, we cloned the RHO1 gene by the PCR and cross-hybridization methods. Sequence analysis revealed that the Candida RHO1 gene has a 597-nucleotide region which encodes a putative 22.0-kDa peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts that Candida albicans Rho1p is 82.9\% identical to Saccharomyces Rho1p and contains all the domains conserved among Rho-type GTPases from other organisms. The Candida albicans RHO1 gene could rescue a S. cerevisiae strain containing a rho1 deletion. Furthermore, recombinant Candida albicans Rho1p could reactivate the beta-1,3-glucan synthesis activities of both C. albicans and S. cerevisiae membranes in which endogenous Rho1p had been depleted by Tergitol NP-40-NaCl treatment. Candida albicans Rho1p was copurified with the beta-1,3-glucan synthase putative catalytic subunit, Candida albicans Gsc1p, by product entrapment. Candida albicans Rho1p was shown to interact directly with Candida albicans Gsc1p in a ligand overlay assay and a cross-linking study. These results indicate that Candida albicans Rho1p acts in the same manner as Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rho1p to regulate beta-1,3-glucan synthesis.},

  abstract = {Exosomes have emerged as important mediators of intercellular communication. Although their modes of action have been elucidated, the molecular mechanisms underlying their secretion, sorting of molecules, uptake into recipient cells, and biological distribution in vivo remain elusive. Here, we present a novel system for quantifying secreted exosomes by introducing ectopic or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of luciferase-fusion exosome markers such as CD63. This luciferase-based method makes it possible to measure exosomes secreted into the culture medium with high linearity and wide dynamic range in a high-throughput manner. We demonstrate that data obtained by luminescent quantification are well correlated with data obtained by conventional nanoparticle tracking analysis under multiple conditions. In addition, our system is capable of evaluating the recipient cells or tissues that take up exosomes, as well as visualizing exosomes in vivo. The proposed system represents a powerful tool for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying exosome production, uptake, and long-term distribution.},

  abstract = {Candida albicans is the most common cause of serious fungal disease in humans. Creation of isogenic null mutants of this diploid organism, which requires sequential gene targeting, allows dissection of virulence mechanisms. Published analyses of such mutants show a near-perfect correlation between C. albicans pathogenicity and the ability to undergo a yeast-to-hypha morphological switch in vitro. However, most studies have used mutants constructed with a marker that is itself a virulence determinant and therefore complicates their interpretation. Using alternative markers, we created {$\sim$}3,000 homozygous deletion strains affecting 674 genes, or roughly 11\% of the C. albicans genome. Screening for infectivity in a mouse model and for morphological switching and cell proliferation in vitro, we identified 115 infectivity-attenuated mutants, of which nearly half demonstrated normal morphological switching and proliferation. Analysis of such mutants revealed that virulence requires the glycolipid glucosylceramide. To our knowledge, this is the first C. albicans small molecule that has been found to be required specifically for virulence.},

  abstract = {In budding yeast, Tup1 and Ssn6/Cyc8 form a corepressor that regulates a large number of genes. This Tup1-Ssn6 corepressor appears to be conserved from yeast to man. In the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans, Tup1 regulates cellular morphogenesis, phenotypic switching, and metabolism, but the role of Ssn6 remains unclear. We show that there are clear differences in the morphological and invasive phenotypes of C. albicans ssn6 and tup1 mutants. Unlike Tup1, Ssn6 depletion promoted morphological events reminiscent of phenotypic switching rather than filamentous growth. Transcript profiling revealed minimal overlap between the Ssn6 and Tup1 regulons. Hypha-specific genes, which are repressed by Tup1 and Nrg1, were not derepressed in ssn6 cells under the conditions studied. In contrast, the phase specific gene WH11 was derepressed in ssn6 cells, but not in tup1 or nrg1 cells. Hence Ssn6 and Tup1 play distinct roles in C. albicans. Nevertheless, both Ssn6 and Tup1 were required for the Nrg1-mediated repression of an artificial NRE promoter, and lexA-Nrg1 mediated repression in the C. albicans one-hybrid system. These observations are explained in models that are generally consistent with the Tup1-Ssn6 paradigm in budding yeast.},

  abstract = {In an effort to bring novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers or even potential targets for vaccine design for systemic candidiasis (SC) into the open, a systematic proteomic approach coupled with bioinformatic analysis was used to decode the serological response to Candida wall immunome in SC patients. Serum levels of IgG antibodies against Candida wall-associated proteins (proteins secreted from protoplasts in active wall regeneration, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and identified by mass spectrometry) were measured in 45 SC patients, 57 non-SC patients, and 61 healthy subjects by Western blotting. Two-way hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis of their serum anti-Candida wall antibody expression patterns discriminated SC patients from controls and highlighted the heterogeneity of their expression profiles. Multivariate logistic regression models demonstrated that high levels of antibodies against glucan 1,3-{$\beta$}-glucosidase (Bgl2p) and the anti-wall phosphoglycerate kinase antibody seropositivity were the only independent predictors of SC. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed no difference between their combined evaluation and measurement of anti-Bgl2p antibodies alone. In a logistic regression model adjusted for known prognostic factors for mortality, SC patients with high anti-Bgl2p antibody levels or a positive anti-wall enolase antibody status, which correlated with each other, had a reduced 2-month risk of death. After controlling for each other, only the seropositivity for anti-wall enolase antibodies was an independent predictor of a lower risk of fatality, supporting that these mediated the protective effect. No association between serum anti-cytoplasmic enolase antibody levels and outcomes was established, suggesting a specific mechanism of enolase processing during wall biogenesis. We conclude that serum anti-Bgl2p antibodies are a novel accurate diagnostic biomarker for SC and that, at high levels, they may provide protection by modulating the anti-wall enolase antibody response. Furthermore serum anti-wall enolase antibodies are a new prognostic indicator for SC and confer protection against it. Bgl2p and wall-associated enolase could be valuable candidates for future vaccine development.},

The exponential interest in exosomes experienced during recent years is due to their important roles in health and disease and to their potential clinical application in therapy and diagnosis. However, important aspects of the biology of exosomes remain unknown. To explore the use of exosomes in the clinic, it is essential that the basic molecular mechanisms behind the transport and function of these vesicles are better understood. We have here summarized what is presently known about how exosomes are formed and released by cells. Moreover, other cellular processes related to exosome biogenesis and release, such as autophagy and lysosomal exocytosis are presented. Finally, methodological aspects related to exosome release studies are discussed.},

  issn = {1932-6157, 1941-7330},
  abstract = {One of the most common analysis tasks in genomic research is to identify genes that are differentially expressed (DE) between experimental conditions. Empirical Bayes (EB) statistical tests using moderated genewise variances have been very effective for this purpose, especially when the number of biological replicate samples is small. The EB procedures can, however, be heavily influenced by a small number of genes with very large or very small variances. This article improves the differential expression tests by robustifying the hyperparameter estimation procedure. The robust procedure has the effect of decreasing the informativeness of the prior distribution for outlier genes while increasing its informativeness for other genes. This effect has the double benefit of reducing the chance that hypervariable genes will be spuriously identified as DE while increasing statistical power for the main body of genes. The robust EB algorithm is fast and numerically stable. The procedure allows exact small-sample null distributions for the test statistics and reduces exactly to the original EB procedure when no outlier genes are present. Simulations show that the robustified tests have similar performance to the original tests in the absence of outlier genes but have greater power and robustness when outliers are present. The article includes case studies for which the robust method correctly identifies and downweights genes associated with hidden covariates and detects more genes likely to be scientifically relevant to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in the limma software package freely available from the Bioconductor repository.},

To evaluate the impact of these different methods on the resulting EV preparations, plasma EVs were isolated using SEC, PEG and PROSPR, and their total protein content, NTA and Cryo-electron microscopy profiles, and EV-markers were compared. Also, their effect on recipient cells was tested. Low protein content and Cryo-EM analysis showed that SEC removed most of the overabundant soluble plasma proteins, which were not removed using PEG and partially by PROSPR. Moreover, only SEC allowed the detection of the EV-markers CD9, CD63 and CD81, LGALS3BP and CD5L, suggesting a putative interference of the precipitating agents in the structure/composition of the EVs. Furthermore, PEG and PROSPR-based EV isolation resulted in reduced cell viability in vitro.

  abstract = {Extracellular polysaccharides are key constituents of the biofilm matrix of many microorganisms. One critical carbohydrate component of Candida albicans biofilms, {$\beta$}-1,3 glucan, has been linked to biofilm protection from antifungal agents. In this study, we identify three glucan modification enzymes that function to deliver glucan from the cell to the extracellular matrix. These enzymes include two predicted glucan transferases and an exo-glucanase, encoded by BGL2, PHR1, and XOG1, respectively. We show that the enzymes are crucial for both delivery of {$\beta$}-1,3 glucan to the biofilm matrix and for accumulation of mature matrix biomass. The enzymes do not appear to impact cell wall glucan content of biofilm cells, nor are they necessary for filamentation or biofilm formation. We demonstrate that mutants lacking these genes exhibit enhanced susceptibility to the commonly used antifungal, fluconazole, during biofilm growth only. Transcriptional analysis and biofilm phenotypes of strains with multiple mutations suggest that these enzymes act in a complementary fashion to distribute matrix downstream of the primary {$\beta$}-1,3 glucan synthase encoded by FKS1. Furthermore, our observations suggest that this matrix delivery pathway works independently from the C. albicans ZAP1 matrix formation regulatory pathway. These glucan modification enzymes appear to play a biofilm-specific role in mediating the delivery and organization of mature biofilm matrix. We propose that the discovery of inhibitors for these enzymes would provide promising anti-biofilm therapeutics.},

Total EV carbohydrates were ethanol-precipitated from preparations depleted of lipids and proteins, then analyzed by chemical degradation, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance and size-exclusion chromatography. EV glycosyl residues of Glc, Man, and Gal comprised most probably two major components: a high molecular mass 4,6-{$\alpha$}-glucan and a galactofuranosylmannan, possibly an oligomer, bearing a 2-{$\alpha$}-Manp main chain linked to {$\beta$}-Galf (1,3) and {$\alpha$}-Manp (1,6) end units.

Glycan microarrays allowed identification of EV surface lectin(s), while plant lectin microarray profiling revealed terminal Man and GlcNAc residues exposed at the EVs surface. Mammalian lectin microarray profiling showed that DC-SIGN receptors recognized surface carbohydrate in Paracoccidioides EVs. Our results suggest that oligosaccharides, cytoplasmic storage, and cell wall polysaccharides can be exported in fungal EVs, which also expose surface PAMPs and lectins.

Fungal EVs contain a complex combination of macromolecules, including proteins, lipids and glycans. In this work, we aimed to describe and characterize RNA in EV preparations from the human pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans, Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis and Candida albicans, and from the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The EV RNA content consisted mostly of molecules less than 250 nt long and the reads obtained aligned with intergenic and intronic regions or specific positions within the mRNA. We identified 114 ncRNAs, among them, six small nucleolar (snoRNA), two small nuclear (snRNA), two ribosomal (rRNA) and one transfer (tRNA) common to all the species considered, together with 20 sequences with features consistent with miRNAs. We also observed some copurified mRNAs, as suggested by reads covering entire transcripts, including those involved in vesicle-mediated transport and metabolic pathways. We characterized for the first time RNA molecules present in EVs produced by fungi. Our results suggest that RNA-containing vesicles may be determinant for various biological processes, including cell communication and pathogenesis.},

The proteome, lipidome, RNA content, and carbohydrate composition of EVs from Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Paracoccidioides lutzii were characterized. However, the effects of P. brasiliensis EVs on the host immune system have not yet been investigated. Herein, we verified that EVs from P. brasiliensis induce the production of proinflammatory mediators by murine macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of EV to macrophages also promoted transcription of the M1-polarization marker iNOs and diminish that of the M2 markers Arginase-1, Ym-1, and FIZZ-1. Furthermore, the augmented expression of M2-polarization markers, stimulated by IL-4 plus IL-10, was reverted toward an M1 phenotype in response to secondary stimulation with EVs from P. brasiliensis. The ability of EVs from P. brasiliensis to promote M1 polarization macrophages favoring an enhanced fungicidal activity, demonstrated by the decreased CFU recovery of internalized yeasts, with comparable phagocytic efficacy. Our results suggest that EVs from P. brasiliensis can modulate the innate immune response and affect the relationship between P. brasiliensis and host immune cells.},

More recently, the identification of membrane vesicle (MV) production by some Gram-positive bacteria, parasites, fungi, mycobacteria and infected host cells has significantly broadened the field of MV research and emphasized their importance to pathogenesis. In this review, we will focus on discussing recent advances in the field of bacterial MV biogenesis and the mechanisms whereby they modulate immunity and contribute to pathogenesis. We will highlight findings identifying the contribution of extracellular vesicles produced by Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, parasites, and infected host cells in mediating pathogenesis in addition to the functions of MVs produced by commensal bacteria.

  abstract = {Extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, are small membranous vesicles released from many biotypes, contributing to the disease progression and spreading. These extracellular vesicles provide an important mode of cell-to-cell communication by delivering proteins, lipids and RNA to target cells. Exosomes are found associated with neurodegenerative diseases, which are characterised by progressive degeneration of neurons and often associated with misfolded protein. The common diseases include Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's diseases (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and the prion diseases. Of all neurodegenerative diseases, prion diseases are classified as the distinctive group owing to its transmissible and infectious nature of misfolded prion protein. The infectious prion particles have been demonstrated to be present in exosomes to spread prion infectivity within cells. Similarly, misfolded proteins involved in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyloid-{$\beta$} and tau in AD, {$\alpha$}-synuclein in PD, and superoxide dismutase 1 in ALS have been demonstrated to exploit exosomes for induced spreading of misfolded proteins in a prion-like mechanism. Furthermore, RNA molecules can be taken up by the recipient cells as cargo in exosomes. These RNAs can module the expression of the target genes by repressing or inhibiting protein translation. Here we review the role of exosomes in prion diseases and other common neurodegenerative diseases, and discuss the potential of these vesicles for disease pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {Summary
All serious fungal infections need appropriate antifungal therapy for successful patient outcome. Only a few classes of antifungal drugs are available, so the emergence of resistance to single drug classes and now multidrug resistance greatly hampers patient management. Azole resistance among Candida and Aspergillus species is one of the greatest challenges to clinical success, followed by echinocandin and multidrug resistance among some Candida species, especially Candida glabrata. The spread of agriculturally derived azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus and emerging threats such as multidrug resistant Candida auris are also alarming. The molecular mechanisms that cause drug resistance are naturally occurring in less susceptible species and are acquired in strains of susceptible organisms. Drug resistance mechanisms include altered drug-target interactions, reduced cellular drug concentrations mediated by drug efflux transporters, and permeability barriers associated with biofilms. Although C auris is inherently multidrug resistant, other strains typically develop resistance through stepwise selection of multiple drug-resistance mechanisms. Cellular stress induced by drug treatment promotes adaptation, which contributes to breakthrough resistance. Drug exposure also drives the emergence of resistance. An effective antifungal stewardship programme is essential to control drug resistance, and should incorporate rapid fungal diagnostics, therapeutic drug monitoring, and clinical intervention teams. The development of better diagnostic tools and strategies that allow targeted use of antifungals is essential to preserve drug effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Fungal infections due to Candida and Aspergillus species cause extensive morbidity and mortality, especially among immunosuppressed patients, and antifungal therapy is critical to patient management. Yet only a few drug classes are available to treat invasive fungal diseases, and this problem is compounded by the emergence of antifungal resistance. Echinocandin drugs are the preferred choice to treat candidiasis. They are the first cell wall\textendash{}active agents and target the fungal-specific enzyme glucan synthase, which catalyzes the biosynthesis of {$\beta$}-1,3-glucan, a key cell wall polymer. Therapeutic failures occur rarely among common Candida species, with the exception of Candida glabrata, which is frequently multidrug resistant. Echinocandin resistance in susceptible species is always acquired during therapy. The mechanism of resistance involves amino acid changes in hot-spot regions of Fks subunits of glucan synthase, which decrease the sensitivity of the enzyme to drug. Cellular stress response pathways lead to drug adaptation, which promotes the formation of resistant fks strains. Clinical factors promoting echinocandin resistance include empiric therapy, prophylaxis, gastrointestinal reservoirs, and intra-abdominal infections. A better understanding of the echinocandin-resistance mechanism, along with cellular and clinical factors promoting resistance, will facilitate more effective strategies to overcome and prevent echinocandin resistance.},

There is, however, extensive documentation of intrinsic and developed resistance to azole antifungals among several Candida species. As the frequency of azole resistant Candida isolates in the clinical setting increases, it is essential to elucidate the mechanisms of such resistance in order to both preserve and improve upon the azole class of antifungals for the treatment of Candida infections.

There appears to be considerable inter- and intra-continental variability in the global incidence of these fungal infections. Trichophyton rubrum, T. interdigitale (mentagrophytes var. interdigitale), M. canis, M. audouinii, T. tonsurans and T. verrucosum are the most common, but the attack rates and incidence of specific mycoses can vary widely. Local socio-economic conditions and cultural practices can also influence the prevalence of a particular infection in a given area. For example, tinea pedis (athlete's foot) is more prevalent in developed countries than in emerging economies and is likely to be caused by the anthropophilic germ T. rubrum. In poorer countries, scalp infections (tinea capitis) caused by T. soudanense or M. audouinii are more prevalent.

We have also identified new genes required for pH-dependent filamentation, a trait previously associated with virulence. One newly identified gene, MDS3, is required for expression in alkaline media of two filamentation-associated genes, HWP1 and ECE1, but is not required for expression of other pH-response genes. In S. cerevisiae, the two MDS3 homologs are required for growth in alkaline media, thus arguing that Mds3p function in adaptation to external pH changes is conserved.

  abstract = {Rapid and long-distance secretion of membrane components is critical for hyphal formation in filamentous fungi, but the mechanisms responsible for polarized trafficking are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that in Candida albicans, the majority of the Golgi complex is redistributed to the distal region during hyphal formation. Randomly distributed Golgi puncta in yeast cells cluster toward the growing tip during hyphal formation, remain associated with the distal portion of the filament during its extension, and are almost absent from the cell body. This restricted Golgi localization pattern is distinct from other organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum, vacuole and mitochondria, which remain distributed throughout the cell body and hypha. Hyphal-induced positioning of the Golgi and the maintenance of its structural integrity requires actin cytoskeleton, but not microtubules. Absence of the formin Bni1 causes a hyphal-specific dispersal of the Golgi into a haze of finely dispersed vesicles with a sedimentation density no different from that of normal Golgi. These results demonstrate the existence of a hyphal-specific, Bni1-dependent cue for Golgi integrity and positioning at the distal portion of the hyphal tip, and suggest that filamentous fungi have evolved a novel strategy for polarized secretion, involving a redistribution of the Golgi to the growing tip.},

  abstract = {In eukaryotes, the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is a major cytosolic cuproprotein with a small fraction residing in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) to protect against respiratory superoxide. Curiously, the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans is predicted to express two cytosolic SODs including Cu/Zn containing SOD1 and manganese containing SOD3. As part of a copper starvation response, C. albicans represses SOD1 and induces the non-copper alternative SOD3. While both SOD1 and SOD3 are predicted to exist in the same cytosolic compartment, their potential role in mitochondrial oxidative stress had yet to be investigated. We show here that under copper replete conditions, a fraction of the Cu/Zn containing SOD1 localizes to the mitochondrial IMS to guard against mitochondrial superoxide. However in copper starved cells, localization of the manganese containing SOD3 is restricted to the cytosol leaving the mitochondrial IMS devoid of SOD. We observe that during copper starvation, an alternative oxidase (AOX) form of respiration is induced that is not coupled to ATP synthesis but maintains mitochondrial superoxide at low levels even in the absence of IMS SOD. Surprisingly, the copper-dependent cytochrome c oxidase (COX) form of respiration remains high with copper starvation. We provide evidence that repression of SOD1 during copper limitation serves to spare copper for COX and maintain COX respiration. Overall, the complex copper starvation response of C. albicans involving SOD1, SOD3 and AOX minimizes mitochondrial oxidative damage whilst maximizing COX respiration essential for fungal pathogenesis.},

  volume = {9},
  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {Candida albicans is a major cause of invasive fungal infections worldwide. Upon infection and when in contact with human plasma as well as body fluids the fungus is challenged by the activated complement system a central part of the human innate immune response. C. albicans controls and evades host complement attack by binding several human complement regulators like Factor H, Factor H-like protein 1 and C4BP to the surface. Gpm1 (Phosphoglycerate mutase 1) is one fungal Factor H/FHL1 -binding protein. As Gpm1 is surface exposed, we asked whether Gpm1 also contributes to host cell attachment. Here, we show by flow cytometry and by laser scanning microscopy that candida Gpm1 binds to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to keratinocytes (HaCaT), and also to monocytic U937 cells. Wild type candida did bind, but the candida gpm1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} knock-out mutant did not bind to these human cells. In addition Gpm1when attached to latex beads also conferred attachment to human endothelial cells. When analyzing Gpm1-binding to a panel of extracellular matrix proteins, the human glycoprotein vitronectin was identified as a new Gpm1 ligand. Vitronectin is a component of the extracellular matrix and also a regulator of the terminal complement pathway. Vitronectin is present on the surface of HUVEC and keratinocytes and acts as a surface ligand for fungal Gpm1. Gpm1 and vitronectin colocalize on the surface of HUVEC and HaCaT as revealed by laser scanning microscopy. The Gpm1 vitronectin interaction is inhibited by heparin and the interaction is also ionic strength dependent. Taken together, Gpm1 the candida surface protein binds to vitronectin and mediates fungal adhesion to human endothelial cells. Thus fungal Gpm1 and human vitronectin represent a new set of proteins that are relevant for fungal attachment to human cells interaction. Blockade of the Gpm1 vitronectin interaction might provide a new target for therapy.},

The dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase Lpd1 is a catalytic component of PDC. Lpd1 has been recovered during 2D-PAGE screening for the hypha-specific proteins in Candida albicans. The Lpd1 protein, as visualized by a GFP-fusion, was localized in the mitochondria during the logarithmic yeast growth and the filamentous growth. The GFP signal was prevalent and relatively uniform toward the tip of the hyphae. The functions of the LPD1 gene were investigated by construction of lpd1/lpd1 mutant strain. This homozygous deletion mutant was unable to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources including glycerol, ethanol, acetate, and citrate. In addition, the lpd1/lpd1 strain exhibited a slow-growth phenotype on glucose-containing media and a marked sensitivity to 0.5mM of hydrogen peroxide. LPD1 was shown to be required for filamentous growth under a serum-containing hyphal-inducing condition. These results suggest a possible relationship between mitochondrial respiration and filamentous growth.},

Tetraspanins comprise a diverse family of four-pass transmembrane proteins that play critical roles in the immune, reproductive, genitourinary, and auditory systems. Despite their pervasive roles in human physiology, little is known about the structure of tetraspanins or the molecular mechanisms underlying their various functions. Here, we report the crystal structure of human CD81, a full-length tetraspanin. The transmembrane segments of CD81 pack as two largely separated pairs of helices, capped by the large extracellular loop (EC2) at the outer membrane leaflet. The two pairs of helices converge at the inner leaflet to create an intramembrane pocket with additional electron density corresponding to a~bound cholesterol molecule within the cavity. Molecular dynamics simulations identify an additional conformation in which EC2 separates substantially from the transmembrane domain. Cholesterol binding appears to modulate CD81 activity in cells, suggesting a potential mechanism for regulation of tetraspanin function.},

  abstract = {Palmitoylation of tetraspanins affects protein\textendash{}protein interactions, suggesting a key role in the assembly of the tetraspanin web. Since palmitoylation occurs on intracellular cysteine residues, we examined whether mutating these residues in the human tetraspanin CD81 would affect the association of CD81 with other surface membrane proteins. Mutation of at least six of the eight juxtamembrane cysteines was required to completely eliminate detectable CD81 palmitoylation, indicating that several sites can be palmitoylated. Interestingly, these mutated proteins exhibited reduced cell surface detection by antibody compared to wild-type CD81, but this was not due to differences in the level of protein expression, trafficking to the cell surface, protein stability, or anti-CD81 antibody binding affinity. Instead, the mutant CD81 proteins appeared to be partially hidden from detection by anti-CD81 antibody, presumably due to altered interactions with other proteins at the cell surface. Associations with the known CD81-interacting proteins CD9 and EWI-2 were also impaired with the mutant CD81 proteins. Taken together, these findings indicate that mutation of juxtamembrane cysteines alters the interaction of CD81 with other proteins, either because of reduced palmitoylation, structural alterations in the mutant proteins, or a combination of both factors, and this affects the CD81 microenvironment on the cell surface.},

  abstract = {The development of exosomes as delivery vehicles requires understanding how and where exogenously administered exosomes are distributed in vivo. In the present study, we designed a fusion protein consisting of Gaussia luciferase and a truncated lactadherin, gLuc-lactadherin, and constructed a plasmid expressing the fusion protein. B16-BL6 murine melanoma cells were transfected with the plasmid, and exosomes released from the cells were collected by ultracentrifugation. Strong luciferase activity was detected in the fraction containing exosomes, indicating their efficient labeling with gLuc-lactadherin. Then, the labeled B16-BL6 exosomes were intravenously injected into mice, and their tissue distribution was evaluated. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the exosome blood concentration\textendash{}time profile revealed that B16-BL6 exosomes disappeared very quickly from the blood circulation with a half-life of approximately 2min. Little luciferase activity was detected in the serum at 4h after exosome injection, suggesting rapid clearance of B16-BL6 exosomes in vivo. Moreover, sequential in vivo imaging revealed that the B16-BL6 exosome-derived signals distributed first to the liver and then to the lungs. These results indicate that gLuc-lactadherin labeling is useful for tracing exosomes in vivo and that B16-BL6 exosomes are rapidly cleared from the blood circulation after systemic administration.},

Current techniques to study exosome physiology are based on isolation procedures after secretion, precluding direct and dynamic insight into the mechanics of exosome biogenesis and the regulation of their release.

We designed tetraspanin-based pH-sensitive optical reporters that detect MVB\textendash{}PM fusion using live total internal reflection fluorescence and dynamic correlative light\textendash{}electron microscopy. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that MVB\textendash{}PM fusion frequency is reduced by depleting the target membrane SNAREs SNAP23 and syntaxin-4 but also can be induced in single cells by stimulation of the histamine H1 receptor (H1HR). Interestingly, activation of H1R1 in HeLa cells increases Ser110 phosphorylation of SNAP23, promoting MVB\textendash{}PM fusion and the release of CD63-enriched exosomes. Using this single-cell resolution approach, we highlight the modulatory dynamics of MVB exocytosis that will help to increase our understanding of exosome physiology and identify druggable targets in exosome-associated pathologies.},

In this report, we demonstrate by fluorescence microscopy that mammalian macrophages can incorporate extracellular vesicles produced by C. neoformans. Incubation of cryptococcal vesicles with murine macrophages resulted in increased levels of extracellular tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-{$\alpha$}), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and transforming growth factor {$\beta$} (TGF-{$\beta$}). Vesicle preparations also resulted in a dose-dependent stimulation of nitric oxide production by phagocytes, suggesting that vesicle components stimulate macrophages to produce antimicrobial compounds. Treated macrophages were more effective at killing C. neoformans yeast. Our results indicate that the extracellular vesicles of C. neoformans can stimulate macrophage function, apparently activating these phagocytic cells to enhance their antimicrobial activity.

Five major peptides (T1 to T5) were shown to induce a vigorous proliferation of PBMC from the majority of the eight healthy human subjects tested. With the use of synthetic peptides, critical amino acid sequences of the two most immunoactive (T1 and T2) peptides were determined. Similar to what was found for the MP65 molecule, no PBMC multiplication was induced by the antigenic peptides in cultures of naive cord blood cells. The amino acid sequence analysis of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides of MP65 demonstrated a substantial homology with the deduced sequences of two cell wall proteins ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, encoded by the genesYRM305C and YGR279C. However, the antigenic peptides were those showing the least similarity with the corresponding regions of the above proteins. In particular, the lymphoproliferation-inducing sequence of the T1 peptide scored only 20\% identity with the homologous regions of S. cerevisiaeproteins.

In this paper we report the GXM distribution in C. neoformans cells sectioned by cryoultramicrotomy and visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and polysaccharide immunogold staining. Cryosections of fungal cells showed high preservation of intracellular organelles and cell wall structure. Incubation of cryosections with an antibody to GXM revealed that cytoplasmic structures associated to vesicular compartments and reticular membranes are in close proximity to the polysaccharide. GXM was generally found in association with the membrane of intracellular compartments and within different layers of the cell wall. Analysis of extracellular fractions from cryptococcal supernatants by transmission electron microscopy in combination with serologic, chromatographic and spectroscopic methods revealed fractions containing GXM and lipids. These results indicate an intimate association of GXM and lipids in both intracellular and extracellular spaces consistent with polysaccharide synthesis and transport in membrane-associated structures.},

The genes encoding phosphatidylserine synthase (CHO1) and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD1 and PSD2) are Candida albicans genes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis, and mutations in these genes affect mitochondrial function, cell wall thickness, and virulence in mice. We tested the roles of these genes in several agar-based secretion assays and observed that the cho1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} and psd1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} psd2{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} strains manifested less protease and phospholipase activity. Since extracellular vesicles (EVs) are surrounded by a lipid membrane, we investigated the effects of these mutations on EV structure, composition, and biological activity. The cho1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} mutant releases EVs comparable in size to wild-type EVs, but EVs from the psd1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} psd2{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} strain are much larger than those from the wild type, including a population of {$>$}100-nm EVs not observed in the EVs from the wild type. Proteomic analysis revealed that EVs from both mutants had a significantly different protein cargo than that of EVs from the wild type. EVs were tested for their ability to activate NF-{$\kappa$}B in bone marrow-derived macrophage cells. While wild-type and psd1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} psd2{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} mutant-derived EVs activated NF-{$\kappa$}B, the cho1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} mutant-derived EV did not. These studies indicate that the presence and absence of these C. albicans genes have qualitative and quantitative effects on EV size, composition, and immunostimulatory phenotypes that highlight a complex interplay between lipid metabolism and vesicle production.},

Here, we describe extracellular vesicles carrying highly immunogenic {$\alpha$}-linked galactopyranosyl ({$\alpha$}-Gal) epitopes in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. P. brasiliensis is a dimorphic fungus that causes human paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). For vesicle preparations, cell-free supernatant fluids from yeast cells cultivated in Ham's defined medium-glucose were concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration system and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 \texttimes{} g. P. brasiliensis antigens were present in preparations from phylogenetically distinct isolates Pb18 and Pb3, as observed in immunoblots revealed with sera from PCM patients. In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), vesicle components containing {$\alpha$}-Gal epitopes reacted strongly with anti-{$\alpha$}-Gal antibodies isolated from both Chagas' disease and PCM patients, with Marasmius oreades agglutinin (MOA) (a lectin that recognizes terminal {$\alpha$}-Gal), but only faintly with natural anti-{$\alpha$}-Gal. Reactivity was inhibited after treatment with {$\alpha$}-galactosidase. Vesicle preparations analyzed by electron microscopy showed vesicular structures of 20 to 200 nm that were labeled both on the surface and in the lumen with MOA. In P. brasiliensis cells, components carrying {$\alpha$}-Gal epitopes were found distributed on the cell wall, following a punctuated confocal pattern, and inside large intracellular vacuoles. Lipid-free vesicle fractions reacted with anti-{$\alpha$}-Gal in ELISA only when not digested with {$\alpha$}-galactosidase, while reactivity with glycoproteins was reduced after {$\beta$}-elimination, which is indicative of partial O-linked chain localization. Our findings open new areas to explore in terms of host-parasite relationships in PCM and the role played in vivo by vesicle components and {$\alpha$}-galactosyl epitopes.},

A central question in the biology of Cryptococcus neoformans, the causative agent of cryptococcosis, is the mechanism by which capsular polysaccharide synthesized inside the cell is exported to the extracellular environment for capsule assembly and release. We demonstrate that C. neoformans produces extracellular vesicles during in vitro growth and animal infection. Vesicular compartments, which are transferred to the extracellular space by cell wall passage, contain glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), a component of the cryptococcal capsule, and key lipids, such as glucosylceramide and sterols. A correlation between GXM-containing vesicles and capsule expression was observed. The results imply a novel mechanism for the release of the major virulence factor of C. neoformans whereby polysaccharide packaged in lipid vesicles crosses the cell wall and the capsule network to reach the extracellular environment.},

Secretory vesicles in C. neoformans appear to be correlated with exosome-like compartments derived from multivesicular bodies. Extracellular vesicles manifested various sizes and morphologies, including electron-lucid membrane bodies and electron-dense vesicles. Seventy-six proteins were identified by proteomic analysis, including several related to virulence and protection against oxidative stress. Biochemical tests indicated laccase and urease activities in vesicles. In addition, different vesicle proteins were recognized by sera from patients with cryptococcosis. These results reveal an efficient and general mechanism of secretion of pathogenesis-related molecules in C. neoformans, suggesting that extracellular vesicles function as ``virulence bags'' that deliver a concentrated payload of fungal products to host effector cells and tissues.},

In this report, we investigate the role of two previously uncharacterized Rho proteins, encoded by the Candida albicans RHO3 (CaRHO3) and CaCRL1/CaRHO4 genes. The CaRHO3 gene was found to contain one intron. Promoter shutdown experiments using a MET3 promoter-controlled RHO3 revealed a strong cell polarity defect and a partially depolarized actin cytoskeleton. Hyphal growth after promoter shutdown was abolished in rho3 mutants even in the presence of a constitutively active ras1(G13V) allele, and existing germ tubes became swollen. Deletion of C. albicans RHO4 indicated that it is a nonessential gene and that rho4 mutants were phenotypically different from rho3. Two distinct phenotypes of rho4 cells were elongated cell morphology and an unexpected cell separation defect generating chains of cells. Colony morphology of crl1/rho4 resulted in a growth-dependent smooth (long cell cycle length) or wrinkled (short cell cycle length) phenotype. This phenotype was additionally dependent on the rho4 cell separation defect and was also found in a Cacht3 chitinase mutant that shows a strong cytokinesis defect. The overexpression of the endoglucanase encoding the ENG1 gene, but not CHT3, suppressed the cell separation defect of crl1/rho4 but could not suppress the cell elongation phenotype. C. albicans Crl1/Rho4 and Bnr1 both localize to septal sites in yeast and hyphal cells but not to the hyphal tip. Deletion of RHO4 and BNR1 produced similar morphological phenotypes. Based on the localization of Rho4 and on the rho4 mutant phenotype, we propose a model in which Rho4p may function as a regulator of cell polarity, breaking the initial axis of polarity found during early bud growth to promote the construction of a septum.},

Rac1 is localized to the plasma membrane, yet its distribution is more homogenous than that of Cdc42, with no enrichment at the tips of either buds or hyphae. In addition, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching results indicate that Rac1 and Cdc42 have different dynamics at the membrane. Furthermore, overexpression of Rac1 does not complement Cdc42 function, and conversely, overexpression of Cdc42 does not complement Rac1 function. Thus, Rac1 and Cdc42, although highly similar to one another, have different roles in C. albicans development.},

  abstract = {Hyphal growth is prevalent during most Candida albicans infections. Current cell division models, which are based on cytological analyses of C. albicans, predict that hyphal branching is intimately linked with vacuolar inheritance in this fungus. Here we report the molecular validation of this model, showing that a specific mutation that disrupts vacuolar inheritance also affects hyphal division. The armadillo repeat-containing protein Vac8p plays an important role in vacuolar inheritance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The VAC8 gene was identified in the C. albicans genome sequence and was resequenced. Homozygous C. albicans vac8{$\Delta$} deletion mutants were generated, and their phenotypes were examined. Mutant vac8{$\Delta$} cells contained fragmented vacuoles, and minimal vacuolar material was inherited by daughter cells in hyphal or budding forms. Normal rates of growth and hyphal extension were observed for the mutant hyphae on solid serum-containing medium. However, branching frequencies were significantly increased in the mutant hyphae. These observations are consistent with a causal relationship between vacuolar inheritance and the cell division cycle in the subapical compartments of C. albicans hyphae. The data support the hypothesis that cytoplasmic volume, rather than cell size, is critical for progression through G1.},

C. albicans is the most frequent species, but considerable differences are found between the number of cases caused by C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. Studies from Northern Europe and the USA reported a high number of cases caused by C. glabrata, whereas studies from Spain and Brazil demonstrated a lower number of cases caused by C. glabrata and a higher number of cases attributed to C. parapsilosis. Globally, the frequency of C. albicans is decreasing, while that of C. glabrata and C. krusei is stable, and C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis are increasing. Patient characteristics and prior antifungal therapy also have a considerable influence on the distribution and frequency of Candida spp., regardless of the geographical area. C. albicans is more frequent in patients aged up to 18 years, the frequency of C. parapsilosis decreases with age, and C. glabrata is more common in the elderly. Finally, the presence of horizontal transmission of Candida spp. isolates (reported mainly in patients from the adult medical and post-surgical ICU, patients from oncology\textendash{}haematology units, and neonates) can affect species distribution.},

Previous studies have revealed the presence of EV in culture supernatants from fungal pathogens, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Sporothrix schenckii, Malassezia sympodialis and Candida albicans. Here we investigated the size, composition, kinetics of internalization by bone marrow-derived murine macrophages (MO) and dendritic cells (DC), and the immunomodulatory activity of C. albicans EV. We also evaluated the impact of EV on fungal virulence using the Galleria mellonella larvae model. By transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering, we identified two populations ranging from 50 to 100 nm and 350 to 850 nm. Two predominant seroreactive proteins (27 kDa and 37 kDa) and a group of polydispersed mannoproteins were observed in EV by immunoblotting analysis. Proteomic analysis of C. albicans EV revealed proteins related to pathogenesis, cell organization, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, response to stress, and several other functions. The major lipids detected by thin-layer chromatography were ergosterol, lanosterol and glucosylceramide. Short exposure of MO to EV resulted in internalization of these vesicles and production of nitric oxide, interleukin (IL)-12, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-{$\beta$}) and IL-10. Similarly, EV-treated DC produced IL-12p40, IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. In addition, EV treatment induced the up-regulation of CD86 and major histocompatibility complex class-II (MHC-II). Inoculation of G. mellonella larvae with EV followed by challenge with C. albicans reduced the number of recovered viable yeasts in comparison with infected larvae control. Taken together, our results demonstrate that C. albicans EV were immunologically active and could potentially interfere with the host responses in the setting of invasive candidiasis.},

The results indicated that the effect of farnesol was dependent on the concentration of this compound and the initial adherence time, and preincubation with 300 {$\mu$}M farnesol completely inhibited biofilm formation. Supernatant media recovered from mature biofilms inhibited the ability of planktonic C. albicans to form filaments, indicating that a morphogenetic autoregulatory compound is produced in situ in biofilms. Northern blot analysis of RNA extracted from cells in biofilms indicated that the levels of expression of HWP1, encoding a hypha-specific wall protein, were decreased in farnesol-treated biofilms compared to the levels in controls. Our results indicate that farnesol acts as a naturally occurring quorum-sensing molecule which inhibits biofilm formation, and we discuss its potential for further development and use as a novel therapeutic agent.},

Drug efflux, mediated by plasma membrane transporters, is a major resistance mechanism, and clinically significant resistance in Candida albicans is accompanied by increased transcription of the genes CDR1 and CDR2, encoding plasma membrane ABC-type transporters Cdr1p and Cdr2p. The relative importance of each transporter protein for efflux-mediated resistance in C. albicans, however, is unknown; neither the relative amounts of each polypeptide in resistant isolates nor their contributions to efflux function have been determined. We have exploited the pump-specific properties of two antibody preparations, and specific pump inhibitors, to determine the relative expression and functions of Cdr1p and Cdr2p in 18 clinical C. albicans isolates. The antibodies and inhibitors were standardized using recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains that hyper-express either protein in a host strain with a reduced endogenous pump background. In all 18 C. albicans strains, including 13 strains with reduced FLC susceptibilities, Cdr1p was present in greater amounts (2- to 20-fold) than Cdr2p. Compounds that inhibited Cdr1p-mediated function, but had no effect on Cdr2p efflux activity, significantly decreased the resistance to FLC of seven representative C. albicans isolates, whereas three other compounds that inhibited both pumps did not cause increased chemosensitization of these strains to FLC. We conclude that Cdr1p expression makes a greater functional contribution than does Cdr2p to FLC resistance in C. albicans.},

  abstract = {Invasive candidiasis (IC) is a leading cause of mycosis-associated mortality in the United States. We examined data from the National Center for Health Statistics and reviewed recent literature in order to update the epidemiology of IC. IC-associated mortality has remained stable, at approximately 0.4 deaths per 100,000 population, since 1997, while mortality associated with invasive aspergillosis has continued to decline. Candida albicans remains the predominant cause of IC, accounting for over half of all cases, but Candida glabrata has emerged as the second most common cause of IC in the United States, and several less common Candida species may be emerging, some of which can exhibit resistance to triazoles and/or amphotericin B. Crude and attributable rates of mortality due to IC remain unacceptably high and unchanged for the past 2 decades. Nonpharmacologic preventive strategies should be emphasized, including hand hygiene; appropriate use, placement, and care of central venous catheters; and prudent use of antimicrobial therapy. Given that delays in appropriate antifungal therapy are associated with increased mortality, improved use of early empirical, preemptive, and prophylactic therapies should also help reduce IC-associated mortality. Several studies have now identified important variables that can be used to predict risk of IC and to help guide preventive strategies such as antifungal prophylaxis and early empirical therapy. However, improved non-culture-based diagnostics are needed to expand the potential for preemptive (or early directed) therapy. Further research to improve diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic strategies is necessary to reduce the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with IC.},

  abstract = {Polarized growth is a fundamental property of cell growth and development. It requires the delivery of post-Golgi secretory vesicles to the site of polarized growth. This process is mediated by Rab GTPases activated by their guanine exchange factors (GEFs). The human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, can grow in a budded yeast form or in a highly polarized hyphal form, and thus provides a model to study this phenomenon. During hyphal, but not yeast growth, secretory vesicles accumulate in an apical body called a Spitzenk{\"o}rper, which acts to focus delivery of the vesicles to the tip. Post-Golgi transport of secretory vesicles is mediated by the Rab GTPase Sec4, activated by its GEF Sec2. Using a combination of deletion mapping, in vitro mutagenesis, an analogue-sensitive allele of Cdc28 and an in vitro kinase assay, we show that localization of Sec2 to the Spitzenk{\"o}rper and normal hyphal development requires phosphorylation of Serine 584 by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. Thus, as well as controlling passage through the cell cycle, Cdc28 has an important function in controlling polarized secretion.},

Analysis of Ca-Sur7 showed that this four transmembrane domain protein localized to stable punctate patches, similar to the plasma membrane subdomains known as eisosomes or MCC that were discovered in S. cerevisiae. The localization of Ca-Sur7 depended on sphingolipid synthesis. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, a C. albicans sur7{$\Delta$} mutant displayed defects in endocytosis and morphogenesis. Septins and actin were mislocalized, and cell wall synthesis was very abnormal, including long projections of cell wall into the cytoplasm. Several phenotypes of the sur7{$\Delta$} mutant are similar to the effects of inhibiting {$\beta$}-glucan synthase, suggesting that the abnormal cell wall synthesis is related to activation of chitin synthase activity seen under stress conditions. These results expand the roles of eisosomes by demonstrating that Sur7 is needed for proper plasma membrane organization and cell wall synthesis. A conserved Cys motif in the first extracellular loop of fungal Sur7 proteins is similar to a characteristic motif of the claudin proteins that form tight junctions in animal cells, suggesting a common role for these tetraspanning membrane proteins in forming specialized plasma membrane domains.},

During in vitro growth on certain nutrient-poor media, C. albicans and C. dubliniensis are the only yeast species which are able to produce chlamydospores, large thick-walled cells of unknown function. Interestingly, only C. dubliniensis forms pseudohyphae with abundant chlamydospores when grown on Staib medium, while C. albicans grows exclusively as a budding yeast. In order to further our understanding of chlamydospore development and assembly, we compared the global transcriptional profile of both species during growth in liquid Staib medium by RNA sequencing. We also included a C. albicans mutant in our study which lacks the morphogenetic transcriptional repressor Nrg1. This strain, which is characterized by its constitutive pseudohyphal growth, specifically produces masses of chlamydospores in Staib medium, similar to C. dubliniensis. This comparative approach identified a set of putatively chlamydospore-related genes. Two of the homologous C. albicans and C. dubliniensis genes (CSP1 and CSP2) which were most strongly upregulated during chlamydospore development were analysed in more detail. By use of the green fluorescent protein as a reporter, the encoded putative cell wall related proteins were found to exclusively localize to C. albicans and C. dubliniensis chlamydospores. Our findings uncover the first chlamydospore specific markers in Candida species and provide novel insights in the complex morphogenetic development of these important fungal pathogens.},

Factor H (FH) is the main fluid-phase inhibitor of the alternative pathway. Many pathogens can hijack FH from the host and protect themselves from complement-dependent killing. Candida albicans is a clinically important opportunistic yeast, expressing different FH binding molecules on its cell surface, which allow complement evasion. One such FH binding molecule is the transmembrane protein ``High affinity glucose transporter 1'' (Hgt1p), involved in glucose metabolism. This study demonstrated that Hgt1p transcription and expression is induced and highest at the low, but physiological glucose concentration of 0.1\%, why this concentration was used throughout the study. We also demonstrated the transport of Hgt1p to the fungal cell wall surface by vesicle trafficking and its release by exosomes containing Hgt1p integrated in the vesicular membrane. We corroborated Hgt1p as FH binding molecule. A polyclonal anti-Hgt1p antibody was created which interfered with the binding of FH, present in normal human serum to the fungal cell wall . A chimeric molecule consisting of FH domains 6 and 7 fused to human IgG1 Fc (FH6.7/Fc) even more comprehensively blocked FH binding, likely because FH6.7/Fc diverted FH away from fungal FH ligands other than Hgt1p. Reduced FH binding to the yeast was associated with a concomitant increase in C3b/iC3b deposition, resulted in significantly increased in vitro phagocytosis and killing by human neutrophils.In conclusion, Hgt1p also exhibits non-canonical functions such as binding FH after its export to the cell wall. Blocking Hgt1p-FH interactions may represent a tool to enhance complement activation on the fungal surface to promote phagocytosis and killing of C. albicans.},

  abstract = {In prostate cancer and other malignancies sensitive and robust biomarkers are lacking or have relevant limitations. Prostate specific antigen (PSA), the only biomarker widely used in prostate cancer, is suffering from low specificity. Exosomes offer new perspectives in the discovery of blood-based biomarkers. Here we present a proof-of principle study for a proteomics-based identification pipeline, implementing existing data sources, to exemplarily identify exosome-based biomarker candidates in prostate cancer.
Exosomes from malignant PC3 and benign PNT1A cells and from FBS-containing medium were isolated using sequential ultracentrifugation. Exosome and control samples were analyzed on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. Proteomic data is available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD003651. We developed a scoring scheme to rank 64 proteins exclusively found in PC3 exosomes, integrating data from four public databases and published mass spectrometry data sets. Among the top candidates, we focused on the tight junction protein claudin 3. Retests under serum-free conditions using immunoblotting and immunogold labeling confirmed the presence of claudin 3 on PC3 exosomes. Claudin 3 levels were determined in the blood plasma of patients with localized (n = 58; 42 with Gleason score 6\textendash{}7, 16 with Gleason score {$\geq$}8) and metastatic prostate cancer (n = 11) compared with patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 15) and healthy individuals (n = 15) using ELISA, without prior laborious exosome isolation. ANOVA showed different CLDN3 plasma levels in these groups (p = 0.004). CLDN3 levels were higher in patients with Gleason {$\geq$}8 tumors compared with patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (p = 0.012) and Gleason 6\textendash{}7 tumors (p = 0.029). In patients with localized tumors CLDN3 levels predicted a Gleason score {$\geq$} 8 (AUC = 0.705; p = 0.016) and did not correlate with serum PSA.
By using the described workflow claudin 3 was identified and validated as a potential blood-based biomarker in prostate cancer. Furthermore this workflow could serve as a template to be used in other cancer entities.},

  abstract = {Ubiquitin-binding proteins play an important role in eukaryotes by translating differently linked polyubiquitin chains into proper cellular responses. Current knowledge about ubiquitin-binding proteins and ubiquitin linkage-selective interactions is mostly based on case-by-case studies. We have recently reported a method called ubiquitin interactor affinity enrichment\textendash{}mass spectrometry (UbIA-MS), which enables comprehensive identification of ubiquitin interactors for all ubiquitin linkages from crude cell lysates. One major strength of UbIA-MS is the fact that ubiquitin interactors are enriched from crude cell lysates, in which proteins are present at endogenous levels, contain biologically relevant post-translational modifications (PTMs) and are assembled in native protein complexes. In addition, UbIA-MS uses chemically synthesized nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin, which mimics native diubiquitin and is inert to cleavage by endogenous deubiquitinases (DUBs). Here, we present a detailed protocol for UbIA-MS that proceeds in five stages: (i) chemical synthesis of ubiquitin precursors and click chemistry for the generation of biotinylated nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin baits, (ii) in vitro affinity purification of ubiquitin interactors, (iii) on-bead interactor digestion, (iv) liquid chromatography (LC)\textendash{}MS/MS analysis and (v) data analysis to identify differentially enriched proteins. The computational analysis tools are freely available as an open-source R software package, including a graphical interface. Typically, UbIA-MS allows the identification of dozens to hundreds of ubiquitin interactors from any type of cell lysate, and can be used to study cell type or stimulus-dependent ubiquitin interactions. The nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin synthesis can be completed in 3 weeks, followed by ubiquitin interactor enrichment and identification, which can be completed within another 2 weeks.},

They are shed following the selective incorporation of a host of molecular cargo including multiple types of proteins and nucleic acids. In addition to providing new insight into the etiology of complex human diseases, microvesicles also show great promise as a tool for advanced diagnosis and therapy as we move forward into a new age of personalized medicine.

  abstract = {Tumor cell invasion requires the molecular and physical adaptation of both the cell and its microenvironment. Here we show that tumor cells are able to switch between the use of microvesicles and invadopodia to facilitate invasion through the extracellular matrix. Invadopodia formation accompanies the mesenchymal mode of migration on firm matrices and is facilitated by Rac1 activation. On the other hand, during invasion through compliant and deformable environments, tumor cells adopt an amoeboid phenotype and release microvesicles. Notably, firm matrices do not support microvesicle release, whereas compliant matrices are not conducive to invadopodia biogenesis. Furthermore, Rac1 activation is required for invadopodia function, while its inactivation promotes RhoA activation and actomyosin contractility required for microvesicle shedding. Suppression of RhoA signaling blocks microvesicle formation but enhances the formation of invadopodia. Finally, we describe Rho-mediated pathways involved in microvesicle biogenesis through the regulation of myosin light chain phosphatase. Our findings suggest that the ability of tumor cells to switch between the aforementioned qualitatively distinct modes of invasion may allow for dissemination across different microenvironments.},

  abstract = {Tspan5 is a member of a subgroup of tetraspanins referred to as TspanC8. These tetraspanins directly interact with the metalloprotease ADAM10, regulate its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent trafficking, and differentially regulate its ability to cleave various substrates and activate Notch signaling. The study of Tspan5 has been limited by the lack of good antibodies. This study provides new insights into Tspan5 using new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including two mAbs recognizing both Tspan5 and the highly similar tetraspanin Tspan17. Using these mAbs, we show that endogenous Tspan5 associates with ADAM10 in human cell lines and in mouse tissues where it is the most abundant, such as the brain, the lung, the kidney, or the intestine. We also uncover two TspanC8-specific motifs in the large extracellular domain of Tspan5 that are important for ADAM10 interaction and exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. One of the anti-Tspan5 mAbs does not recognize Tspan5 associated with ADAM10, providing a convenient way to measure the fraction of Tspan5 not associated with ADAM10. This fraction is minor in the cell lines tested, and it increases upon transfection of cells with TspanC8 tetraspanins such as Tspan15 or Tspan33 that inhibit Notch signaling. Finally, two antibodies inhibit ligand-induced Notch signaling, and this effect is stronger in cells depleted of the TspanC8 tetraspanin Tspan14, further indicating that Tspan5 and Tspan14 can compensate for each other in Notch signaling.},

Our investigation focuses on the hypothesis that the CD9 second extracellular loop (EC2) is important in modulating cell adhesive events. Using a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell expression system, we previously reported that CD9 expression inhibited cell adhesion to fibronectin and fibronectin matrix assembly. For the first time, a functional epitope on CD9 EC2 that regulates these processes is described. Binding of mAb7, an EC2-specific anti-CD9 monoclonal antibody, reversed the CD9 inhibitory activity on CHO cell adhesion and fibronectin matrix assembly. This reversal of cell phenotype also was observed in CHO cells expressing CD9 EC2 truncations. Furthermore, our data showed that the EC2 sequence173LETFTVKSCPDAIKEVFDNK192 was largely responsible for the CD9-mediated CHO cell phenotype. Two peptides, 135K-V172 (peptide 5b) and168P-I185 (peptide 6a), selectively blocked mAb7 binding to soluble CD9 and to CD9 on intact cells. These active peptides reversed the influence of CD9 expression on CHO cell adhesion to fibronectin. In addition, confocal microscopy revealed that CD9 colocalized with the integrin {$\alpha$}5{$\beta$}1 and cytoskeletal F-actin in punctate clusters on the cell surface, particularly at the cell margins. Immunoprecipitation studies confirmed CD9 association with {$\beta$}1 integrin. The cellular distribution and colocalization of focal adhesion kinase and {$\alpha$}-actinin with cytoskeletal actin was also influenced by CD9 expression. Thus, CD9 may exhibit its effect by modulating the composition of adhesive complexes important in facilitating cell adhesion and matrix assembly.},

Finally, we demonstrated that the antibody specifically reduces invasion in the HCT116 and LoVo mCRC cell lines more potently than in the HCT-8 and SW480 non-mCRC cell lines. Our data suggest that TSPAN8-LEL may play an important role in mCRC cell invasion, and that the antibody we have developed could be a useful tool for inhibiting the invasion of TSPAN8-expressing mCRCs.},

  abstract = {The use of PCR-based techniques for directed gene alterations has become a standard tool in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In our efforts to increase the speed of functional analysis of Candida albicans genes, we constructed a modular system of plasmid vectors and successfully applied PCR-amplified functional analysis (FA)-cassettes in the transformation of C. albicans. These cassettes facilitate: (a) gene disruptions; (b) tagging of 3{${'}$}-ends of genes with green fluorescent protein (GFP); and (c) replacements of endogenous promoters to achieve regulated expression. The modules consists of a core of three selectable marker genes, CaURA3, CaHIS1 and CaARG4. Modules for C-terminal GFP-tagging were generated by adding GFP-sequences flanked at the 5{${'}$}-end by a (Gly-Ala)3-linker and at the 3{${'}$}-end by the S. cerevisiae URA3-terminator to these selection markers. Promoter exchange modules consist of the respective marker genes followed by the regulatable CaMAL2 or CaMET3 promoters at their 3{${'}$}-ends. In order to ensure a reliably high rate of homologous gene targeting, the flanking homology regions required a size of 100 bp of gene-specific sequences, which were provided with the oligonucleotide primers. The use of shorter flanking homology regions produced unsatisfactory results with C. albicans strain BWP17. With these new modules only a minimal set of primers is required to achieve the functional analysis of C. albicans genes and, therefore, provides a basic tool to increase the number of functionally characterized C. albicans genes of this human pathogen in the near future.

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Protein trafficking in the secretory pathway, for example the secretion of Wnt proteins, requires tight regulation. These ligands activate Wnt signaling pathways and are crucially involved in development and disease. Wnt is transported to the plasma membrane by its cargo receptor Evi, where Wnt/Evi complexes are endocytosed and sorted onto exosomes for long-range secretion. However, the trafficking steps within the endosomal compartment are not fully understood. The promiscuous SNARE Ykt6 folds into an auto-inhibiting conformation in the cytosol, but a portion associates with membranes by its farnesylated and palmitoylated C-terminus. Here, we demonstrate that membrane detachment of Ykt6 is essential for exosomal Wnt secretion. We identified conserved phosphorylation sites within the SNARE domain of Ykt6, which block Ykt6 cycling from the membrane to the cytosol. In \emph{Drosophila}, Ykt6 RNAi-mediated block of Wg secretion is rescued by wildtype but not phosphomimicking Ykt6. We show that phosphomimicking Ykt6 accumulates at membranes, while wildtype Ykt6 regulates Wnt trafficking between the plasma membrane and multivesicular bodies in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, we show that exosomal sorting of Wnts is fine-tuned by a regulatory switch in Ykt6 shifting it from a membrane-bound to cytosolic state at the level of endosomal maturation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Small GTPases of the Ypt/rab family are involved in the regulation of vesicular transport. These GTPases apparently function during the targeting of vesicles to the acceptor compartment. Two members of the Ypt/rab family, Ypt1p and Sec4p, have been shown to regulate early and late steps of the yeast exocytic pathway, respectively. Here we tested the role of two newly identified GTPases, Ypt31p and Ypt32p. These two proteins share 81\% identity and 90\% similarity, and belong to the same protein subfamily as Ypt1p and Sec4p. Yeast cells can tolerate deletion of either the YPT31 or the YPT32 gene, but not both. These observations suggest that Ypt31p and Ypt32p perform identical or overlapping functions. Cells deleted for the YPT31 gene and carrying a conditional ypt32 mutation exhibit protein transport defects in the late exocytic pathway, but not in vacuolar protein sorting. The ypt31/ 32 mutant secretory defect is clearly downstream from that displayed by a ypt1 mutant and is similar to that of sec4 mutant cells. However, electron microscopy revealed that while sec4 mutant cells accumulate secretory vesicles, ypt31/32 mutant cells accumulate aberrant Golgi structures. The ypt31/32 phenotype is epistatic to that of a sec1 mutant, which accumulates secretory vesicles. Together, these results indicate that the Ypt31/32p GTPases are required for a step that occurs in the transGolgi compartment, between the reactions regulated by Ypt1p and Sec4p. This step might involve budding of vesicles from the trans-Golgi. Alternatively, Ypt31/ 32p might promote secretion indirectly, by allowing fusion of recycling vesicles with the trans-Golgi compartment.},

  volume = {8},
  issn = {1059-1524},
  abstract = {The protein trafficking machinery of eukaryotic cells is employed for protein secretion and for the localization of resident proteins of the exocytic and endocytic pathways. Protein transit between organelles is mediated by transport vesicles that bear integral membrane proteins (v-SNAREs) which selectively interact with similar proteins on the target membrane (t-SNAREs), resulting in a docked vesicle. A novelSaccharomyces cerevisiae SNARE protein, which has been termed Vti1p, was identified by its sequence similarity to known SNAREs. Vti1p is a predominantly Golgi-localized 25-kDa type II integral membrane protein that is essential for yeast viability. Vti1p can bind Sec17p (yeast SNAP) and enter into a Sec18p (NSF)-sensitive complex with the cis-Golgi t-SNARE Sed5p. This Sed5p/Vti1p complex is distinct from the previously described Sed5p/Sec22p anterograde vesicle docking complex. Depletion of Vti1p in vivo causes a defect in the transport of the vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y through the Golgi. Temperature-sensitive mutants of Vti1p show a similar carboxypeptidase Y trafficking defect, but the secretion of invertase and gp400/hsp150 is not significantly affected. The temperature-sensitive vti1 growth defect can be rescued by the overexpression of the v-SNARE, Ykt6p, which physically interacts with Vti1p. We propose that Vti1p, along with Ykt6p and perhaps Sft1p, acts as a retrograde v-SNARE capable of interacting with the cis-Golgi t-SNARE Sed5p.},

  abstract = {Vesicular transport between secretory compartments requires specific recognition molecules called SNAREs. Here we report the identification of three putative SNAREs, p14 (Sft1p), p28 (Gos1p), and a detailed characterization of p26 (Ykt6p). All three were originally isolated as interacting partners of the cis Golgi target membrane-associated SNARE Sed5p, when Sec18p (yeast NSF) was inactivated. YKT6 is an essential gene that codes for a novel vesicle-associated SNARE functioning at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi transport step in the yeast secretory pathway. Depletion of Ykt6p results in the accumulation of the p1 precursor (endoplasmic reticulum form) of the vacuolar enzyme carboxypeptidase Y and morphological abnormalities consistent with a defect in secretion. Membrane localization of Ykt6p is essential for protein function and is normally mediated by isoprenylation. However, replacement of the isoprenylation motif with a bona fide transmembrane anchor results in a functional protein confirming that membrane localization, but not isoprenylation per se, is required for function. Ykt6p and its homologues are highly conserved from yeast to human as demonstrated by the functional complementation of the loss of Ykt6p by its human counterpart. This is the first example of a human SNARE protein functionally replacing a yeast SNARE. This observation implies that the specific details of the vesicle targeting code, like the genetic code, are conserved in evolution.},

Ykt6p is a yeast R-SNARE  protein that has been implicated in retrograde transport to the  cis-Golgi compartment. Ykt6p has been also been found to fractionate  with vacuole membranes and participate in a vacuolar SNARE complex in  homotypic vacuole fusion. To investigate the role of Ykt6p in membrane traffic  to the vacuole we generated temperature-sensitive mutations in YKT6.  One mutation produces an early Golgi block to secretion, and overexpression of  the SNARE protein Sft1p suppresses the growth and secretion defects of this  mutation. These results are consistent with Ykt6p and Sft1p participating in a  SNARE complex associated with retrograde transport to the cis-Golgi.  A second set of mutations in YKT6 specifically affects post-Golgi  membrane traffic to the vacuole, and the effects of these mutations are not  suppressed by Sft1p overexpression. Defects are seen in carboxypeptidase Y  sorting, alkaline phosphatase transport, and aminopeptidase I delivery, and in  one mutant, overexpression of the SNARE protein Nyv1p suppresses the alkaline  phosphatase transport defect. By mutationally separating early and late  requirements for Ykt6p, our findings have revealed that Ykt6p is a R-SNARE  protein that functions directly in the three biosynthetic pathways to the  vacuole.},

Proteins interacting with TEM receptors cytoplasmic regions presented a considerable degree of overlap, although some highly specific CD81 tetraspanin ligands, such as Rac GTPase, were detected. Quantitative proteomics showed that TEM ligands account for a great proportion of the exosome proteome and that a selective repertoire of CD81-associated molecules, including Rac, is not correctly routed to exosomes in cells from CD81-deficient animals. Our data provide evidence that insertion into TEM may be necessary for protein inclusion into the exosome structure.},

This proportion of CREs can potentially inform on the disease stage and enable non-invasive monitoring of inter-individual variations in tumor-receptor expression levels. Our approach utilises a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) platform to quantify the proportion of CREs in a two-step strategy that involves (i) initial isolation of bulk exosome population using tetraspanin biomarkers (i.e., CD9, CD63), and (ii) subsequent detection of CREs within the captured bulk exosomes using tumor-specific markers (e.g., human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)). We demonstrate the isolation of bulk exosome population and detection of as low as 10\% HER2(+) exosomes from samples containing designated proportions of HER2(+) BT474 and HER2(-) MDA-MB-231 cell derived exosomes.

However, its roles in Candida albicans, the leading fungal pathogen in human beings, remain to be detailed. Most recently, we found that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducing conditions led to transcriptional up-regulation of C. albicans autophagy-related (ATG) genes, implying a possible link between autophagy and ER stress response in this pathogen. Using a series of C. albicans ATG mutants and autophagy reporting systems, we found that both treatment of ER stress-related drugs and loss of the ER calcium pump Spf1 promoted autophagic flux of Atg8 and Lap41 (a homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ape1), indicating that these conditions induce autophagy. Moreover, deletion of ATG genes in the spf1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} mutant rendered cells hypersensitive to these drugs and caused activation of UPR, revealing a role of autophagy in alleviating ER stress. In addition, only treatment of tunicamycin and loss of Spf1 in combination increased autophagic flux of the ER component Sec63, suggesting that most of the ER stress-related conditions cause non-selective autophagy rather than selective ER phagy. This study uncovers the important role of C. albicans autophagy in ER stress response and tolerance to antifungal drugs.},

In the course of our studies of differential gene expression associated with dimorphism of C. albicans, we have isolated a gene, designated PHR1, which is regulated in response to the pH of the culture medium. PHR1 expression was repressed at pH values below 5.5 and induced at more alkaline pH. The predicted amino acid sequence of the PHR1 protein was 56\% identical to that of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ggp1/Gas1 protein, a highly glycosylated cell surface protein attached to the membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol. A homozygous null mutant of PHR1 was constructed and found to exhibit a pH-conditional morphological defect. At alkaline pH, the mutant, unlike the parental type, was unable to conduct apical growth of either yeast or hyphal growth forms. This morphological aberration was not associated with defective cytoskeletal polarization or secretion. The results suggest that PHR1 defines a novel function required for apical cell growth and morphogenesis.},

  abstract = {Background
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15\textendash{}20\% of breast cancers but is responsible for a disproportionate number of deaths. We investigated the relevance, in TNBC, of nano-sized exosomes expelled from cells. Specifically, we compared effects of exosomes derived from the claudin-low TNBC cell line Hs578T and its more invasive Hs578Ts(i)8 variant, as well as exosomes from TNBC patient sera compared to normal sera.
Methods
Exosomes were isolated from conditioned media (CM) of Hs578T and Hs578Ts(i)8 cells and from sera by filtration and ultracentrifugation. Successful isolation was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and immunoblotting. Subsequent analysis, of secondary/recipient cells in response to exosomes, included proliferation; motility/migration; invasion; anoikis assays and endothelial tubule formation assays.
Results
Hs578Ts(i)8-exosomes versus Hs578T-exosomes significantly increased the proliferation, migration and invasion capacity of all three recipient cell lines evaluated i.e. SKBR3, MDA-MB-231 and HCC1954. Exosomes from Hs578Ts(i)8 cells also conferred increased invasiveness to parent Hs578T cells. Hs578Ts(i)8-exosomes increased sensitivity of SKBR3, MDA-MB-231 and HCC1954 to anoikis when compared to the effects of Hs578T-exosomes reflecting the fact that Hs578Ts(i)8 cells are themselves innately more sensitive to anoikis. In relation to vasculogenesis and subsequent angiogenesis, Hs578Ts(i)8-exosomes versus Hs578T-exosomes stimulated significantly more endothelial tubules formation. Finally, our pilot translational study showed that exosomes from TNBC patients' sera significantly increased recipient cells' invasion when compared to those derived from age- and gender-matched healthy control sera.
Conclusion
This study supports the hypothesis that TNBC exosomes may be involved in cancer cell-to-cell communication, conferring phenotypic traits to secondary cells that reflect those of their cells of origin.},

  abstract = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication that carry protein, lipids, and nucleic acids via the circulation to target cells whereupon they mediate physiological changes. In pregnancy, EVs are released in high quantities from the placenta and have been postulated to target multiple cell types, including those of the vascular and immune systems. However, most studies of pregnancy-associated EVs have used clinical samples and in vitro models; to date, few studies have taken advantage of murine models in which pregnancy can be precisely timed and manipulated. In this study, we used a murine model to determine whether the quantity of EVs is altered during healthy pregnancy and during inflammation-associated preterm birth. To facilitate data analysis, we developed a novel software package, tidyNano, an R package that provides functions to import, clean, and quickly summarize raw data generated by the nanoparticle tracking device, NanoSight (Malvern Panalytical). We also developed shinySIGHT, a Shiny web application that allows for interactive exploration and visualization of EV data. In mice, EV concentration in blood increased linearly across pregnancy, with significant rises at GD14.5 and 17.5 relative to EV concentrations in nonpregnant females. Additionally, lipopolysaccharide treatment resulted in a significant reduction in circulating EV concentrations relative to vehicle-treated controls at GD16.5 within 4 hours. Use of tidyNano facilitated rapid analysis of EV data; importantly, this package provides a straightforward framework by which diverse types of large datasets can be simply and efficiently analyzed, is freely available under the MIT license, and is hosted on GitHub (https://nguyens7.github.io/tidyNano/). Our data highlight the utility of the mouse as a model of EV biology in pregnancy, and suggest that placental dysfunction is associated with reduced circulating EVs.},
