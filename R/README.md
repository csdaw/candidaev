# R

## Description

This directory contains R script files used throughout the project. Each
file should only contain 1 function or dataset. Many of these functions
have been taken from the *Bioconductor* package
**[DEP](https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.DEP)**<sup>1</sup>, and adapted
for use on basic matrices instead of `SummarizedExperiment` objects.

After installing `candidaev`, an index of all the included
functions/datasets can be viewed in R using:

``` r
help(package = "candidaev")
```
