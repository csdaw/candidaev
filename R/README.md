# R

## Description

This directory contains R script files used throughout the project. Each
file contains one custom function or one data.frame which has been
documented using an roxygen2 skeleton.

After installing `candidaev`, an index of all the included
functions/data.frames can be viewed in R using:

``` r
help(package = "candidaev")
```
