  title = {Glucocerebrosidase Deficiency Promotes Protein Aggregation through Dysregulation of Extracellular Vesicles},
  volume = {14},
  issn = {1553-7404},
  abstract = {Mutations in the glucosylceramidase beta (GBA) gene are strongly associated with neurodegenerative diseases marked by protein aggregation. GBA encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, which breaks down glucosylceramide. A common explanation for the link between GBA mutations and protein aggregation is that lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide causes impaired autophagy. We tested this hypothesis directly by measuring protein turnover and abundance in Drosophila mutants with deletions in the GBA ortholog Gba1b. Proteomic analyses revealed that known autophagy substrates, which had severely impaired turnover in autophagy-deficient Atg7 mutants, showed little to no overall slowing of turnover or increase in abundance in Gba1b mutants. Likewise, Gba1b mutants did not have the marked impairment of mitochondrial protein turnover seen in mitophagy-deficient parkin mutants. Proteasome activity, microautophagy, and endocytic degradation also appeared unaffected in Gba1b mutants. However, we found striking changes in the turnover and abundance of proteins associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have been proposed as vehicles for the spread of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative disease. These changes were specific to Gba1b mutants and did not represent an acceleration of normal aging. Western blotting of isolated EVs confirmed the increased abundance of EV proteins in Gba1b mutants, and nanoparticle tracking analysis revealed that Gba1b mutants had six times as many EVs as controls. Genetic perturbations of EV production in Gba1b mutants suppressed protein aggregation, demonstrating that the increase in EV abundance contributed to the accumulation of protein aggregates. Together, our findings indicate that glucocerebrosidase deficiency causes pathogenic changes in EV metabolism and may promote the spread of protein aggregates through extracellular vesicles.},

  volume = {16},
  issn = {1545-7885},
  abstract = {Cells from all kingdoms of life produce extracellular vesicles (EVs). Their cargo is protected from the environment by the surrounding lipid bilayer. EVs from many organisms have been shown to function in cell\textendash{}cell communication, relaying signals that impact metazoan development, microbial quorum sensing, and pathogenic host\textendash{}microbe interactions. Here, we have investigated the production and functional activities of EVs in a surface-associated microbial community or biofilm of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Crowded communities like biofilms are a context in which EVs are likely to function. Biofilms are noteworthy because they are encased in an extracellular polymeric matrix and because biofilm cells exhibit extreme tolerance to antimicrobial compounds. We found that biofilm EVs are distinct from those produced by free-living planktonic cells and display strong parallels in composition to biofilm matrix material. The functions of biofilm EVs were delineated with a panel of mutants defective in orthologs of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) subunits, which are required for normal EV production in diverse eukaryotes. Most ESCRT-defective mutations caused reduced biofilm EV production, reduced matrix polysaccharide levels, and greatly increased sensitivity to the antifungal drug fluconazole. Matrix accumulation and drug hypersensitivity of ESCRT mutants were reversed by addition of wild-type (WT) biofilm EVs. Vesicle complementation showed that biofilm EV function derives from specific cargo proteins. Our studies indicate that C. albicans biofilm EVs have a pivotal role in matrix production and biofilm drug resistance. Biofilm matrix synthesis is a community enterprise; prior studies of mixed cell biofilms have demonstrated extracellular complementation. Therefore, EVs function not only in cell\textendash{}cell communication but also in the sharing of microbial community resources.},

  volume = {5},
  issn = {1545-7885},
  abstract = {Candida albicans is the most common cause of hematogenously disseminated and oropharyngeal candidiasis. Both of these diseases are characterized by fungal invasion of host cells. Previously, we have found that C. albicans hyphae invade endothelial cells and oral epithelial cells in vitro by inducing their own endocytosis. Therefore, we set out to identify the fungal surface protein and host cell receptors that mediate this process. We found that the C. albicans Als3 is required for the organism to be endocytosed by human umbilical vein endothelial cells and two different human oral epithelial lines. Affinity purification experiments with wild-type and an als3{$\Delta$}/als3{$\Delta$} mutant strain of C. albicans demonstrated that Als3 was required for C. albicans to bind to multiple host cell surface proteins, including N-cadherin on endothelial cells and E-cadherin on oral epithelial cells. Furthermore, latex beads coated with the recombinant N-terminal portion of Als3 were endocytosed by Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human N-cadherin or E-cadherin, whereas control beads coated with bovine serum albumin were not. Molecular modeling of the interactions of the N-terminal region of Als3 with the ectodomains of N-cadherin and E-cadherin indicated that the binding parameters of Als3 to either cadherin are similar to those of cadherin\textendash{}cadherin binding. Therefore, Als3 is a fungal invasin that mimics host cell cadherins and induces endocytosis by binding to N-cadherin on endothelial cells and E-cadherin on oral epithelial cells. These results uncover the first known fungal invasin and provide evidence that C. albicans Als3 is a molecular mimic of human cadherins.},

  abstract = {Abstract Cilia, organelles that function as cellular antennae, are central to the pathogenesis of ?ciliopathies?, including various forms of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). To date, however, the molecular mechanisms controlling ciliogenesis and ciliary function remain incompletely understood. A recently proposed model of cell?cell communication, called ?urocrine signaling?, hypothesizes that a subset of membrane bound vesicles that are secreted into the urinary stream (termed exosome-like vesicles, or ELVs), carry cilia-specific proteins as cargo, interact with primary cilia, and affect downstream cellular functions. This study was undertaken to determine the role of the exocyst, a highly conserved eight-protein trafficking complex, in the secretion and/or retrieval of ELVs. We used Madin?Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells expressing either Sec10-myc (a central component of the exocyst complex) or Smoothened-YFP (a ciliary protein found in ELVs) in experiments utilizing electron gold microscopy and live fluorescent microscopy, respectively. Additionally, human urinary exosomes were isolated via ultracentrifugation and subjected to mass-spectrometry-based proteomics analysis to determine the composition of ELVs. We found, as determined by EM, that the exocyst localizes to primary cilia, and is present in vesicles attached to the cilium. Furthermore, the entire exocyst complex, as well as most of its known regulatory GTPases, are present in human urinary ELVs. Finally, in living MDCK cells, ELVs appear to interact with primary cilia using spinning disc confocal microscopy. These data suggest that the exocyst complex, in addition to its role in ciliogenesis, is centrally involved in the secretion and/or retrieval of urinary ELVs.},

The influence of different ratios of particle populations was tested. Drug delivery nanoparticles and protein aggregates were analyzed by NTA and DLS. Live monitoring of heat-induced protein aggregation was performed with NTA.ResultsNTA was shown to accurately analyze the size distribution of monodisperse and polydisperse samples. Sample visualization and individual particle tracking are features that enable a thorough size distribution analysis. The presence of small amounts of large (1,000 nm) particles generally does not compromise the accuracy of NTA measurements, and a broad range of population ratios can easily be detected and accurately sized. NTA proved to be suitable to characterize drug delivery nanoparticles and protein aggregates, complementing DLS. Live monitoring of heat-induced protein aggregation provides information about aggregation kinetics and size of submicron aggregates.ConclusionNTA is a powerful characterization technique that complements DLS and is particularly valuable for analyzing polydisperse nanosized particles and protein aggregates.},

Because MVs are stable in the circulation, they also may have a key role in secondary colonization and metastasis. Thus, understanding how MVs are generated could have important consequences for interfering with cancer progression. Here we report that the small GTPase RhoA triggers a specific signaling pathway essential for MV biogenesis in various human cancer cells. Inhibiting the activity of different proteins comprising this pathway blocks MV biogenesis in the donor cancer cells and prevents oncogenic transformation in cell culture as well as tumor growth in mice. Although RhoA has often been implicated in human cancer, these findings now highlight a previously unappreciated role for this GTPase in malignant transformation, and demonstrate that blocking MV biogenesis may offer novel approaches for interfering with malignant transformation.},

Since its first release in 2008, it has grown substantially in functionality and can be used in conjunction with more MS platforms. Here we present an updated protocol covering the most important basic computational workflows, including those designed for quantitative label-free proteomics, MS1-level labeling and isobaric labeling techniques. This protocol presents a complete description of the parameters used in MaxQuant, as well as of the configuration options of its integrated search engine, Andromeda. This protocol update describes an adaptation of an existing protocol that substantially modifies the technique. Important concepts of shotgun proteomics and their implementation in MaxQuant are briefly reviewed, including different quantification strategies and the control of false-discovery rates (FDRs), as well as the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs). The MaxQuant output tables, which contain information about quantification of proteins and PTMs, are explained in detail. Furthermore, we provide a short version of the workflow that is applicable to data sets with simple and standard experimental designs. The MaxQuant algorithms are efficiently parallelized on multiple processors and scale well from desktop computers to servers with many cores. The software is written in C\# and is freely available at http://www.maxquant.org.},

Posttranslational modifications are involved in the sorting of specific proteins into exosomes. Here we identify ISGylation as a ubiquitin-like modification that controls exosome release. ISGylation induction decreases MVB numbers and impairs exosome secretion. Using ISG15-knockout mice and mice expressing the enzymatically inactive form of the de-ISGylase USP18, we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that ISG15 conjugation regulates exosome secretion. ISG15 conjugation triggers MVB co-localization with lysosomes and promotes the aggregation and degradation of MVB proteins. Accordingly, inhibition of lysosomal function or autophagy restores exosome secretion. Specifically, ISGylation of the MVB protein TSG101 induces its aggregation and degradation, being sufficient to impair exosome secretion. These results identify ISGylation as a novel ubiquitin-like modifier in the control of exosome production.},

Here we show that exosomes of T, B and dendritic immune cells contain microRNA (miRNA) repertoires that differ from those of their parent cells. We investigate whether miRNAs are exchanged during cognate immune interactions, and demonstrate the existence of antigen-driven unidirectional transfer of miRNAs from the T cell to the APC, mediated by the delivery of CD63+ exosomes on immune synapse formation. Inhibition of exosome production by targeting neutral sphingomyelinase-2 impairs transfer of miRNAs to APCs. Moreover, miRNAs transferred during immune synapsis are able to modulate gene expression in recipient cells. Thus, our results support a mechanism of cellular communication involving antigen-dependent, unidirectional intercellular transfer of miRNAs by exosomes during immune synapsis.},

We report the characterization of the proteomes and ultrastructure of central synapses in zebrafish and analyse the importance of the TSGD. While the TSGD increases overall synapse proteome complexity, the postsynaptic density (PSD) proteome of zebrafish has lower complexity than mammals. A highly conserved set of {$\sim$}1,000 proteins is shared across vertebrates. PSD ultrastructural features are also conserved. Lineage-specific proteome differences indicate that vertebrate species evolved distinct synapse types and functions.

As morphogens, hydrophobic Wnt proteins exert their function over a distance to induce patterning and cell differentiation decisions. Recent studies have identified several factors that are required for the secretion of Wnt proteins; however, how Wnts travel in the extracellular space remains a largely unresolved question. Here we show that Wnts are secreted on exosomes both during Drosophila development and in human cells. We demonstrate that exosomes carry Wnts on their surface to induce Wnt signalling activity in target cells. Together with the cargo receptor Evi/WIs, Wnts are transported through endosomal compartments onto exosomes, a process that requires the R-SNARE Ykt6. Our study demonstrates an evolutionarily conserved functional role of extracellular vesicular transport of Wnt proteins.},

  abstract = {When internalized receptors and other cargo are destined for lysosomal degradation, they are ubiquitinated and sorted by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complexes 0, I, II and III into multivesicular bodies. Multivesicular bodies are formed when cargo-rich patches of the limiting membrane of endosomes bud inwards by an unknown mechanism and are then cleaved to yield cargo-bearing intralumenal vesicles. The biogenesis of multivesicular bodies was reconstituted and visualized using giant unilamellar vesicles, fluorescent ESCRT-0, -I, -II and -III complexes, and a membrane-tethered fluorescent ubiquitin fusion as a model cargo. Here we show that ESCRT-0 forms domains of clustered cargo but does not deform membranes. ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II in combination deform the membrane into buds, in which cargo is confined. ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II localize to the bud necks, and recruit ESCRT-0-ubiquitin domains to the buds. ESCRT-III subunits localize to the bud neck and efficiently cleave the buds to form intralumenal vesicles. Intralumenal vesicles produced in this reaction contain the model cargo but are devoid of ESCRTs. The observations explain how the ESCRTs direct membrane budding and scission from the cytoplasmic side of the bud without being consumed in the reaction.},

Such toxins have not been identified previously in human pathogenic fungi. Here we identify the first, to our knowledge, fungal cytolytic peptide toxin in the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans. This secreted toxin directly damages epithelial membranes, triggers a danger response signalling pathway and activates epithelial immunity. Membrane permeabilization is enhanced by a positive charge at the carboxy terminus of the peptide, which triggers an inward current concomitant with calcium influx. C. albicans strains lacking this toxin do not activate or damage epithelial cells and are avirulent in animal models of mucosal infection.

  abstract = {Amino acids are key sources of nitrogen for growth of Candida albicans. In order to detect and take up these amino acids from a broad range of different and changing nitrogen sources inside the host, this fungus must be able to adapt via its expression of genes for amino acid uptake and further metabolism. We analyzed six C. albicans putative general amino acid permeases based on their homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gap1 general amino acid permease. We generated single- and multiple-deletion strains and found that, based on growth assays and transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulation, Gap2 is the functional orthologue to ScGap1, with broad substrate specificity. Expression analysis showed that expression of all GAP genes is under control of the Csy1 amino acid sensor, which is different from the situation in S. cerevisiae, where the expression of ScGAP1 is not regulated by Ssy1. We show that Gap4 is the functional orthologue of ScSam3, the only S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) transporter in S. cerevisiae, and we report that Gap4 is required for SAM-induced morphogenesis.
IMPORTANCE Candida albicans is a commensal organism that can thrive in many niches in its human host. The environmental conditions at these different niches differ quite a bit, and this fungus must be able to sense these changes and adapt its metabolism to them. Apart from glucose and other sugars, the uptake of amino acids is very important. This is underscored by the fact that the C. albicans genome encodes 6 orthologues of the Saccharomyces. cerevisiae general amino acid permease Gap1 and many other amino acid transporters. In this work, we characterize these six permeases and we show that C. albicans Gap2 is the functional orthologue of ScGap1 and that C. albicans Gap4 is an orthologue of ScSam3, an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) transporter. Furthermore, we show that Gap4 is required for SAM-induced morphogenesis, an important virulence factor of C. albicans.},

  abstract = {Histoplasma capsulatum produces extracellular vesicles containing virulence-associated molecules capable of modulating host machinery, benefiting the pathogen. Treatment of H. capsulatum cells with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) can change the outcome of infection in mice. We evaluated the sizes, enzymatic contents, and proteomic profiles of the vesicles released by fungal cells treated with either protective MAb 6B7 (IgG1) or nonprotective MAb 7B6 (IgG2b), both of which bind H. capsulatum heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60). Our results showed that treatment with either MAb was associated with changes in size and vesicle loading. MAb treatments reduced vesicle phosphatase and catalase activities compared to those of vesicles from untreated controls. We identified 1,125 proteins in vesicles, and 250 of these manifested differences in abundance relative to that of proteins in vesicles isolated from yeast cells exposed to Hsp60-binding MAbs, indicating that surface binding of fungal cells by MAbs modified protein loading in the vesicles. The abundance of upregulated proteins in vesicles upon MAb 7B6 treatment was 44.8\% of the protein quantities in vesicles from fungal cells treated with MAb 6B7. Analysis of orthologous proteins previously identified in vesicles from other fungi showed that different ascomycete fungi have similar proteins in their extracellular milieu, many of which are associated with virulence. Our results demonstrate that antibody binding can modulate fungal cell responses, resulting in differential loading of vesicles, which could alter fungal cell susceptibility to host defenses. This finding provides additional evidence that antibody binding modulates microbial physiology and suggests a new function for specific immunoglobulins through alterations of fungal secretion.
IMPORTANCE Diverse fungal species release extracellular vesicles, indicating that this is a common pathway for the delivery of molecules to the extracellular space. However, there has been no study reporting the impact of antibody binding to the fungal cell on extracellular vesicle release. In the present work, we observed that treatment of H. capsulatum cells with Hsp60-binding MAbs significantly changed the size and cargo of extracellular vesicles, as well as the enzymatic activity of certain virulence factors, such as laccase and phosphatase. Furthermore, this finding demonstrates that antibody binding can directly impact protein loading in vesicles and fungal metabolism. Hence, this work presents a new role for antibodies in the modification of fungal physiology.},

Homologues of representative mutants in S. cerevisiae were deleted in C. albicans and tested for haemoglobin-iron utilization and haemoglobin uptake.

  abstract = {ATP-driven transport proteins belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily perform important functions in cell metabolism and detoxification. Compounds can be actively transported across membranes, including the plasma membrane or organellar membranes. The vacuole is an important organelle in fungal cells required for compartmentalization of metabolites as well as toxic substances. Sequestration into the vacuole is often energy-dependent. We present the first isolation and molecular analysis of a vacuolar ABC transporter gene in the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans. The protein encoded by the MLT1 gene is highly similar to Multiple Drug Resistance-associated Protein (MRP)-like transporters of yeast and higher organisms that form the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR)/MRP subfamily of ABC transporters, a class of proteins so far not characterized in C. albicans. MLT1 expression is extensively growth phase-regulated, and gene transcripts are inducible by metabolic poisons. Gene replacement mutants generated in wild-type C. albicans with the dominant selection marker MPAR showed a profound reduction in virulence in a mouse peritonitis model that was reversed by complementation with an intact MLT1 gene. Hence, this report provides primary evidence for the involvement of vacuolar ABC transporters in fungal virulence.},

The microdomain scaffolding protein flotillin/reggie and related stomatin were thought to be good candidates involved in the formation of SRDs. Here, we show that the flotillin/reggie orthologue FloA tagged with GFP localized as stable dots along the plasma membrane except hyphal tips. Deletion of floA reduced the growth rate, often resulted in irregularly shaped hyphae and impaired SRDs. In contrast, the stomatin orthologue StoA, tagged with GFP, localized at the cortex of young branch tips and at the subapical cortex in long hyphal tips, and was transported bi-directionally along microtubules on endosomes. Deletion of stoA resulted in irregular hyphal morphology and increased branching especially in young hyphae, but did not obviously affect SRDs. Double deletion of floA and stoA enhanced the defects of growth and hyphal morphology. Our data suggest that the plasma membrane of hyphal tips and in subapical regions are distinct and that FloA is involved in membrane compartmentalization and probably indirectly in SRD maintenance.},

The possibility that fungal cells can bind to and internalize EVs remained largely unaddressed. Recent studies, however, demonstrated that fungal cells can internalize host-derived and/or fungal EVs through processes that profoundly modify their regular physiology. To illustrate this novel view, we discuss (i) the uptake of plant EVs by phytopathogenic fungi culminating in growth defects and virulence attenuation, (ii) the influence of EV internalization in prion transmission and biofilm formation in yeast cells, and (iii) the EV-mediated transfer of virulence in isolates of Cryptococcus gattii. These recent observations indicate that the functions exerted by EVs in fungal cells result from previously unknown mechanisms of bidirectional transport, opening new venues for the investigation of how EVs impact fungal physiology.},

The studies reported here show that SEC6 RNAi mutant strains were defective in a number of virulence factors including laccase, urease as well as soluble polysaccharide and demonstrated attenuated virulence in mice. Further analysis by transmission electron microscopy detected the production of abundant extracellular exosomes in wild-type strains containing empty plasmid, but a complete absence in the iSEC6 strain. In addition, a green fluorescent protein\textendash{}laccase fusion protein demonstrated aberrant localization within cytoplasmic vesicles in iSEC6 strains. In contrast, iSEC6 strains retained normal growth at 37\textdegree{}C, as well as substantially normal capsule formation, phospholipase activity and total secreted protein.

  abstract = {The shape and integrity of fungal cells is dependent on the skeletal polysaccharides in their cell walls of which {$\beta$}(1,3)-glucan and chitin are of principle importance. The human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans has four genes, CHS1, CHS2, CHS3 and CHS8, which encode chitin synthase isoenzymes with different biochemical properties and physiological functions. Analysis of the morphology of chitin in cell wall ghosts revealed two distinct forms of chitin microfibrils: short microcrystalline rodlets that comprised the bulk of the cell wall; and a network of longer interlaced microfibrils in the bud scars and primary septa. Analysis of chitin ghosts of chs mutant strains by shadow-cast transmission electron microscopy showed that the long-chitin microfibrils were absent in chs8 mutants and the short-chitin rodlets were absent in chs3 mutants. The inferred site of chitin microfibril synthesis of these Chs enzymes was corroborated by their localization determined in Chsp\textendash{}YFP-expressing strains. These results suggest that Chs8p synthesizes the long-chitin microfibrils, and Chs3p synthesizes the short-chitin rodlets at the same cellular location. Therefore the architecture of the chitin skeleton of C. albicans is shaped by the action of more than one chitin synthase at the site of cell wall synthesis.},

Using quantitative real-time ROS assays, we show here that both yeast and filamentous forms of the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans trigger ROS production in primary innate immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Through a reverse genetic approach, we demonstrate that coculture of macrophages or myeloid dendritic cells with C. albicans cells lacking the superoxide dismutase (SOD) Sod5 leads to massive extracellular ROS accumulation in vitro. ROS accumulation was further increased in coculture with fungal cells devoid of both Sod4 and Sod5. Survival experiments show that C. albicans mutants lacking Sod5 and Sod4 exhibit a severe loss of viability in the presence of macrophages in vitro. The reduced viability of sod5{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} and sod4{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$}sod5{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} mutants relative to wild type is not evident with macrophages from gp91phox-/- mice defective in the oxidative burst activity, demonstrating a ROS-dependent killing activity of macrophages targeting fungal pathogens. These data show a physiological role for cell surface SODs in detoxifying ROS, and suggest a mechanism whereby C. albicans, and perhaps many other microbial pathogens, can evade host immune surveillance in vivo.},

  abstract = {Summary Rho G-proteins are critical for polarized growth, yet little is known about the dynamics of their activation during fungal filamentous growth. We first investigated the roles of Rho1 and Rho2 during Candida albicans filamentous growth. Our results show that Rho1 is required for invasive filamentous growth and that Rho2 is not functionally redundant with Rho1. Using fluorescent reporters, we examined the dynamics of the active form of Rho1 and Cdc42 during initiation and maintenance of hyphal growth. Quantitative analyses indicated that the distribution, but not the level, of these active G-proteins is altered during initial polarization upon germ tube emergence. A comparison of the dynamics of these active G-proteins during budding and hyphal growth indicates that a higher concentration of active Cdc42 was recruited to the germ tube tip than to the bud tip. During hyphal elongation, active Cdc42 remained tightly restricted to the hyphal tip, whereas active Rho1 was broadly associated with the apex and subsequently recruited to the cell division site. Furthermore, our data suggest that phosphoinositide-bis-phosphates are critical to stabilize active Rho1 at the growth site. Together, our results point towards different regulation of Cdc42 and Rho1 activity during initiation and maintenance of filamentous growth.},

  abstract = {The ESCRT-I, -II, and -III protein complexes function to create multivesicular bodies (MVBs) for sorting of proteins destined for the lysosome or vacuole. Prior studies with Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown that the ESCRT-III protein Snf7p interacts with the MVB pathway protein Bro1p as well as its homolog Rim20p. Rim20p has no role in MVB formation, but functions in the Rim101p pH-response pathway; Rim20p interacts with transcription factor Rim101p and is required for the activation of Rim101p by C-terminal proteolytic cleavage. We report here that ESCRT-III proteins Snf7p and Vps20p as well as all ESCRT-I and -II proteins are required for Rim101p proteolytic activation in S. cerevisiae. Mutational analysis indicates that the Rim20p N-terminal region interacts with Snf7p, and an insertion in the Rim20p ``Bro1 domain'' abolishes this interaction, as determined with two-hybrid assays. Disruption of the MVB pathway through mutations affecting non-ESCRT proteins does not impair Rim101p processing. The relationship between the MVB pathway and Rim101p pathway is conserved in Candida albicans, because mutations in four ESCRT subunit genes abolish alkaline pH-induced filamentation, a phenotype previously seen for rim101 and rim20 mutants. The defect is suppressed by expression of C-terminally truncated Rim101-405p, as expected for mutations that block Rim101p proteolytic activation. These results indicate that the ESCRT complexes govern a specific signal transduction pathway and suggest that the MVB pathway may provide a signal that regulates pH-responsive transcription.},

  abstract = {The plasma membrane of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans forms a protective barrier that also mediates many processes needed for virulence, including cell wall synthesis, invasive hyphal morphogenesis, and nutrient uptake. Because compartmentalization of the plasma membrane is believed to coordinate these diverse activities, we examined plasma membrane microdomains termed eisosomes or membrane compartment of Can1 (MCC), which correspond to {$\sim$}200-nm-long furrows in the plasma membrane. A pil1{$\increment$} lsp1{$\increment$} mutant failed to form eisosomes and displayed strong defects in plasma membrane organization and morphogenesis, including extensive cell wall invaginations. Mutation of eisosome proteins Slm2, Pkh2, and Pkh3 did not cause similar cell wall defects, although pkh2{$\increment$} cells formed chains of furrows and pkh3{$\increment$} cells formed wider furrows, identifying novel roles for the Pkh protein kinases in regulating furrows. In contrast, the sur7{$\increment$} mutant formed cell wall invaginations similar to those for the pil1{$\increment$} lsp1{$\increment$} mutant even though it could form eisosomes and furrows. A PH-domain probe revealed that the regulatory lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was enriched at sites of cell wall invaginations in both the sur7{$\increment$} and pil1{$\increment$} lsp1{$\increment$} cells, indicating that this contributes to the defects. The sur7{$\increment$} and pil1{$\increment$} lsp1{$\increment$} mutants displayed differential susceptibility to various types of stress, indicating that they affect overlapping but distinct functions. In support of this, many mutant phenotypes of the pil1{$\increment$} lsp1{$\increment$} cells were rescued by overexpressing SUR7. These results demonstrate that C. albicans eisosomes promote the ability of Sur7 to regulate plasma membrane organization.},

Exosomes were highly purified from the Du145 prostate cancer cell line, by pooling selected fractions from a continuous sucrose gradient (within the density range of 1.1 to 1.2 g/ml), and examined under standard conditions or with additional detergent treatment by the SOMAscanTM array (version 3.0). Lysates of Du145 cells were also prepared, and the profiles were compared. Housekeeping proteins such as cyclophilin-A, LDH, and Hsp70 were present in exosomes, and we identified almost 100 proteins that were enriched in exosomes relative to cells. These included proteins of known association with cancer exosomes such as MFG-E8, integrins, and MET, and also those less widely reported as exosomally associated, such as ROR1 and ITIH4. Several proteins with no previously known exosomal association were confirmed as exosomally expressed in experiments using individual SOMAmer\textregistered{} reagents or antibodies in micro-plate assays. Western blotting confirmed the SOMAscanTM-identified enrichment of exosomal NOTCH-3, L1CAM, RAC1, and ADAM9. In conclusion, we describe here over 300 proteins of hitherto unknown association with prostate cancer exosomes and suggest that the SOMAmer\textregistered{}-based assay technology is an effective proteomics platform for exosome-associated biomarker discovery in diverse clinical settings.},

They have pleiotropic functions such as antigen presentation and intercellular transfer of protein cargo, mRNA, microRNA, lipids, and oncogenic potential. Here we describe the isolation, via sequential immunocapture using anti-A33- and anti-EpCAM-coupled magnetic beads, of two distinct populations of exosomes released from organoids derived from human colon carcinoma cell line LIM1863. The exosome populations (A33-Exos and EpCAM-Exos) could not be distinguished via electron microscopy and contained stereotypical exosome markers such as TSG101, Alix, and HSP70. The salient finding of this study, revealed via gel-based LC-MS/MS, was the exclusive identification in EpCAM-Exos of the classical apical trafficking molecules CD63 (LAMP3), mucin 13 and the apical intestinal enzyme sucrase isomaltase and increased expression of dipeptidyl peptidase IV and the apically restricted pentaspan membrane glycoprotein prominin 1. In contrast, the A33-Exos preparation was enriched with basolateral trafficking molecules such as early endosome antigen 1, the Golgi membrane protein ADP-ribosylation factor, and clathrin. Our observations are consistent with EpCAM- and A33-Exos being released from the apical and basolateral surfaces, respectively, and the EpCAM-Exos proteome profile with widely published stereotypical exosomes. A proteome analysis of LIM1863-derived shed microvesicles (sMVs) was also performed in order to clearly distinguish A33- and EpCAM-Exos from sMVs. Intriguingly, several members of the MHC class I family of antigen presentation molecules were exclusively observed in A33-Exos, whereas neither MHC class I nor MHC class II molecules were observed via MS in EpCAM-Exos. Additionally, we report for the first time in any extracellular vesicle study the colocalization of EpCAM, claudin-7, and CD44 in EpCAM-Exos. Given that these molecules are known to complex together to promote tumor progression, further characterization of exosome subpopulations will enable a deeper understanding of their possible role in regulation of the tumor microenvironment.},

  abstract = {Targeted mass spectrometry by selected reaction monitoring (S/MRM) has proven to be a suitable technique for the consistent and reproducible quantification of proteins across multiple biological samples and a wide dynamic range. This performance profile is an important prerequisite for systems biology and biomedical research. However, the method is limited to the measurements of a few hundred peptides per LC-MS analysis. Recently, we introduced SWATH-MS, a combination of data independent acquisition (DIA) and targeted data analysis that vastly extends the number of peptides/proteins quantified per sample, while maintaining the favorable performance profile of S/MRM. Here we applied the SWATH-MS technique to quantify changes over time in a large fraction of the proteome expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to osmotic stress. We sampled cell cultures in biological triplicates at six time points following the application of osmotic stress and acquired single injection DIA datasets on a high-resolution 5600 tripleTOF instrument operated in SWATH mode. Proteins were quantified by the targeted extraction and integration of transition signal groups from the SWATH-MS datasets for peptides that are proteotypic for specific yeast proteins. We consistently identified and quantified more than 15.000 peptides and 2500 proteins across the 18 samples. We demonstrate high reproducibility between technical and biological replicates across all time points and protein abundances. In addition, we show that the abundance of hundreds of proteins was significantly regulated upon osmotic shock, and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the proteins reacting to osmotic shock are mainly involved in the carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Overall, this study demonstrates the ability of SWATH-MS to efficiently generate reproducible, consistent and quantitatively accurate measurements of a large fraction of a proteome across multiple samples.},

  abstract = {The quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive) made a powerful proteomics instrument available in a benchtop format. It significantly boosted the number of proteins analyzable per hour and has now evolved into a proteomics analysis workhorse for many laboratories. Here we describe the Q Exactive Plus and Q Exactive HF mass spectrometers, which feature several innovations in comparison to the original Q Exactive instrument. A low-resolution pre-filter has been implemented within the injection flatapole, preventing unwanted ions from entering deep into the system, and thereby increasing its robustness. A new segmented quadrupole, with higher fidelity of isolation efficiency over a wide range of isolation windows, provides an almost 2-fold improvement of transmission at narrow isolation widths. Additionally, the Q Exactive HF has a compact Orbitrap analyzer, leading to higher field strength and almost doubling the resolution at the same transient times. With its very fast isolation and fragmentation capabilities, the instrument achieves overall cycle times of 1 s for a top 15 to 20 higher energy collisional dissociation method. We demonstrate the identification of 5000 proteins in standard 90-min gradients of tryptic digests of mammalian cell lysate, an increase of over 40\% for detected peptides and over 20\% for detected proteins. Additionally, we tested the instrument on peptide phosphorylation enriched samples, for which an improvement of up to 60\% class I sites was observed.},

  abstract = {Breast milk contains several macromolecular components with distinctive functions, whereby milk fat globules and casein micelles mainly provide nutrition to the newborn, and whey contains molecules that can stimulate the newborn's developing immune system and gastrointestinal tract. Although extracellular vesicles (EV) have been identified in breast milk, their physiological function and composition has not been addressed in detail. EV are submicron sized vehicles released by cells for intercellular communication via selectively incorporated lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins. Because of the difficulty in separating EV from other milk components, an in-depth analysis of the proteome of human milk-derived EV is lacking. In this study, an extensive LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis was performed of EV that had been purified from breast milk of seven individual donors using a recently established, optimized density-gradient-based EV isolation protocol. A total of 1963 proteins were identified in milk-derived EV, including EV-associated proteins like CD9, Annexin A5, and Flotillin-1, with a remarkable overlap between the different donors. Interestingly, 198 of the identified proteins are not present in the human EV database Vesiclepedia, indicating that milk-derived EV harbor proteins not yet identified in EV of different origin. Similarly, the proteome of milk-derived EV was compared with that of other milk components. For this, data from 38 published milk proteomic studies were combined in order to construct the total milk proteome, which consists of 2698 unique proteins. Remarkably, 633 proteins identified in milk-derived EV have not yet been identified in human milk to date. Interestingly, these novel proteins include proteins involved in regulation of cell growth and controlling inflammatory signaling pathways, suggesting that milk-derived EVs could support the newborn's developing gastrointestinal tract and immune system. Overall, this study provides an expansion of the whole milk proteome and illustrates that milk-derived EV are macromolecular components with a unique functional proteome.},

  abstract = {Deep proteomic analysis of mammalian cell lines would yield an inventory of the building blocks of the most commonly used systems in biological research. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics can identify and quantify proteins in a global and unbiased manner and can highlight the cellular processes that are altered between such systems. We analyzed 11 human cell lines using an LTQ-Orbitrap family mass spectrometer with a ``high field'' Orbitrap mass analyzer with improved resolution and sequencing speed. We identified a total of 11,731 proteins, and on average 10,361 {$\pm$} 120 proteins in each cell line. This very high proteome coverage enabled analysis of a broad range of processes and functions. Despite the distinct origins of the cell lines, our quantitative results showed surprisingly high similarity in terms of expressed proteins. Nevertheless, this global similarity of the proteomes did not imply equal expression levels of individual proteins across the 11 cell lines, as we found significant differences in expression levels for an estimated two-third of them. The variability in cellular expression levels was similar for low and high abundance proteins, and even many of the most highly expressed proteins with household roles showed significant differences between cells. Metabolic pathways, which have high redundancy, exhibited variable expression, whereas basic cellular functions such as the basal transcription machinery varied much less. We harness knowledge of these cell line proteomes for the construction of a broad coverage ``super-SILAC'' quantification standard. Together with the accompanying paper (Schaab, C. MCP 2012, PMID: 22301388) (17) these data can be used to obtain reference expression profiles for proteins of interest both within and across cell line proteomes.},

  abstract = {Preserving the native phenotype of primary cells in vitro is a complex challenge. Recently, hydrogel-based cellular matrices have evolved as alternatives to conventional cell culture techniques. We developed a bacterial cellulose-based aqueous gel-like biomaterial, dubbed Xellulin, which mimics a cellular microenvironment and seems to maintain the native phenotype of cultured and primary cells. When applied to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), it allowed the continuous cultivation of cell monolayers for more than one year without degradation or dedifferentiation. To investigate the impact of Xellulin on the endothelial cell phenotype in detail, we applied quantitative transcriptomics and proteomics and compared the molecular makeup of native HUVEC, HUVEC on collagen-coated Xellulin and collagen-coated cell culture plastic (polystyrene).
Statistical analysis of 12,475 transcripts and 7831 proteins unveiled massive quantitative differences of the compared transcriptomes and proteomes. K-means clustering followed by network analysis showed that HUVEC on plastic upregulate transcripts and proteins controlling proliferation, cell cycle and protein biosynthesis. In contrast, HUVEC on Xellulin maintained, by and large, the expression levels of genes supporting their native biological functions and signaling networks such as integrin, receptor tyrosine kinase MAP/ERK and PI3K signaling pathways, while decreasing the expression of proliferation associated proteins. Moreover, CD34-an endothelial cell differentiation marker usually lost early during cell culture - was re-expressed within 2 weeks on Xellulin but not on plastic. And HUVEC on Xellulin showed a significantly stronger functional responsiveness to a prototypic pro-inflammatory stimulus than HUVEC on plastic.
Taken together, this is one of the most comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic studies of native and propagated HUVEC, which underscores the importance of the morphology of the cellular microenvironment to regulate cellular differentiation, and demonstrates, for the first time, the potential of Xellulin as versatile tool promoting an in vivo-like phenotype in primary and propagated cell culture.},

  abstract = {Protein quantification without isotopic labels has been a long-standing interest in the proteomics field. However, accurate and robust proteome-wide quantification with label-free approaches remains a challenge. We developed a new intensity determination and normalization procedure called MaxLFQ that is fully compatible with any peptide or protein separation prior to LC-MS analysis. Protein abundance profiles are assembled using the maximum possible information from MS signals, given that the presence of quantifiable peptides varies from sample to sample. For a benchmark dataset with two proteomes mixed at known ratios, we accurately detected the mixing ratio over the entire protein expression range, with greater precision for abundant proteins. The significance of individual label-free quantifications was obtained via a t test approach. For a second benchmark dataset, we accurately quantify fold changes over several orders of magnitude, a task that is challenging with label-based methods. MaxLFQ is a generic label-free quantification technology that is readily applicable to many biological questions; it is compatible with standard statistical analysis workflows, and it has been validated in many and diverse biological projects. Our algorithms can handle very large experiments of 500+ samples in a manageable computing time. It is implemented in the freely available MaxQuant computational proteomics platform and works completely seamlessly at the click of a button.},

  abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous form of primary brain tumors, driven by a complex repertoire of oncogenic alterations, including the constitutively active epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII). EGFRvIII impacts both cell-intrinsic and non-cell autonomous aspects of GBM progression, including cell invasion, angiogenesis and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. This is, at least in part, attributable to the release and intercellular trafficking of extracellular vesicles (EVs), heterogeneous membrane structures containing multiple bioactive macromolecules. Here we analyzed the impact of EGFRvIII on the profile of glioma EVs using isogenic tumor cell lines, in which this oncogene exhibits a strong transforming activity. We observed that EGFRvIII expression alters the expression of EV-regulating genes (vesiculome) and EV properties, including their protein composition. Using mass spectrometry, quantitative proteomic analysis and Gene Ontology terms filters, we observed that EVs released by EGFRvIII-transformed cells were enriched for extracellular exosome and focal adhesion related proteins. Among them, we validated the association of pro-invasive proteins (CD44, BSG, CD151) with EVs of EGFRvIII expressing glioma cells, and downregulation of exosomal markers (CD81 and CD82) relative to EVs of EGFRvIII-negative cells. Nano-flow cytometry revealed that the EV output from individual glioma cell lines was highly heterogeneous, such that only a fraction of vesicles contained specific proteins (including EGFRvIII). Notably, cells expressing EGFRvIII released EVs double positive for CD44/BSG, and these proteins also colocalized in cellular filopodia. We also detected the expression of homophilic adhesion molecules and increased homologous EV uptake by EGFRvIII-positive glioma cells. These results suggest that oncogenic EGFRvIII reprograms the proteome and uptake of GBM-related EVs, a notion with considerable implications for their biological activity and properties relevant for the development of EV-based cancer biomarkers.},

  abstract = {Alcohol is one of the most widely misused substances in the world. Alcohol consumption by pregnant women often results in an array of fetal developmental abnormalities, but the damage to the fetus by alcohol remains poorly understood. The limited knowledge regarding the molecular targets of alcohol in the developing fetus constitutes one of the major obstacles in developing effective pharmacological interventions that could prevent fetal damage after alcohol consumption by pregnant women. The fetal cerebral artery is emerging as an important mediator of fetal cerebral damage by maternal alcohol drinking. In the present work, we conduct proteomics analysis of cerebral (basilar) artery lysates of near-term fetal baboons to search for protein targets of fetal alcohol exposure. Our study demonstrates that 3 episodes of binge alcohol exposure during the second trimester-equivalent of human pregnancy are sufficient to render profound changes in fetal cerebral artery proteome. These changes were long-lasting, as they were detected in near-term fetuses. In particular, the relative abundance of 238 proteins differed significantly between control and alcohol-exposed fetuses. Enrichment analysis pointed at the group of metabolic activity proteins as a major class targeted by alcohol. Western blotting confirmed upregulation of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 6 family member A1 (ALDH6A1) in cerebral artery lysates from alcohol-exposed fetuses. This upregulation translated to greater ALDH activity of cerebral artery lysate of near-term fetuses following prenatal alcohol exposure when compared to controls.},

  abstract = {Developing tumors continuously release nano-sized vesicles that represent circulating ``fingerprints'' of the tumor's identity. In gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), we have previously reported that these tumors release ``oncosomes'' carrying the constitutively activated tyrosine kinase (TK) receptor KIT. Despite the clinical utility of TK inhibitors, such as imatinib mesylate (IM), recurrence and metastasis are clinical problems that urge the need to identify new tumor-derived molecules. To this aim, we performed the first high quality proteomic study of GIST-derived exosomes (GDEs) and identified 1,060 proteins composing the core GDE proteome (cGDEp). The cGDEp was enriched in diagnostic markers (e.g. KIT, CD34, ANO1, PROM1, PRKCQ, and ENG), as well as proteins encoded by genes previously reported expressed in GIST (e.g. DPP4, FHL1, CDH11, and KCTD12). Many of these proteins were validated using cell lines, patient-derived KIT+ exosomes, and GIST tissues. We further show that in vitro and in vivo-derived GDE, carry proteins associated with IM response, such as Sprouty homolog 4 (SPRY4), surfeit 4 (SURF4), ALIX, and the cGMP-dependent 3{${'}$},5{${'}$}-cyclic phosphodiesterase 2A (PDE2A). Additionally, we report that the total exosome levels and exosome-associated KIT and SPRY4 protein levels have therapeutic values. In fact, molecular characterization of in vivo-derived KIT+ exosomes indicate significant sorting of p-KITTyr719, total KIT, and SPRY4 after IM-treatment of metastatic patients as compared with the pre-IM levels. Our data suggest that analysis of circulating exosomes levels and molecular markers of IM response in GIST patients with primary and metastatic disease is suitable to develop liquid based biopsies for the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of response to treatment of these tumors. In summary, these findings provide the first insight into the proteome of GIST-derived oncosomes and offers a unique opportunity to further understand their oncogenic elements which contribute to tumorigenesis and drug resistance.

  volume = {152},
  abstract = {Candida albicans ALS3 encodes a large cell-surface glycoprotein that has adhesive properties. Immunostaining of cultured C. albicans germ tubes showed that Als3p is distributed diffusely across the germ tube surface. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy of model catheter biofilms grown using a PALS3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter strain showed GFP production in hyphae throughout the biofilm structure while biofilms grown using a PTPI1-GFP reporter strain showed GFP in both hyphae and yeast-form cells. Model catheter biofilms formed by an als3{$\Delta$}/als3{$\Delta$} strain were weakened structurally and had approximately half the biomass of a wild-type biofilm. Reintegration of a wild-type ALS3 allele restored biofilm mass and wild-type biofilm structure. Production of an Als3p\textendash{}Ag{$\alpha$}1p fusion protein under control of the ALS3 promoter in the als3{$\Delta$}/als3{$\Delta$} strain restored some of the wild-type biofilm structural features, but not the wild-type biofilm mass. Despite its inability to restore wild-type biofilm mass, the Als3p\textendash{}Ag{$\alpha$}1p fusion protein mediated adhesion of the als3{$\Delta$}/als3{$\Delta$} C. albicans strain to human buccal epithelial cells (BECs). The adhesive role of the Als3p N-terminal domain was further demonstrated by blocking adhesion of C. albicans to BECs with immunoglobulin reactive against the Als3p N-terminal sequences. Together, these data suggest that portions of Als3p that are important for biofilm formation may be different from those that are important in BEC adhesion, and that Als3p may have multiple functions in biofilm formation. Overexpression of ALS3 in an efg1{$\Delta$}/efg1{$\Delta$} strain that was deficient for filamentous growth and biofilm formation resulted in growth of elongated C. albicans cells, even under culture conditions that do not favour filamentation. In the catheter biofilm model, the ALS3 overexpression strain formed biofilm with a mass similar to that of a wild-type control. However, C. albicans cells in the biofilm had yeast-like morphology. This result uncouples the effect of cellular morphology from biofilm formation and underscores the importance of Als3p in biofilm development on silicone elastomer surfaces.},

Chitin synthase activity increased steadily, and did not peak shortly after germ tube induction, and activity profiles were similar in germ-tube-competent and germ-tube-negative strains. The phenotype of a {$\Delta$}chs2 null mutant suggested that CHS2 encoded the major enzyme activity in vitro and was largely responsible for elevated chitin synthase activities in microsomal preparations from hyphal cells compared to yeast cells. However, CaChs3p was responsible for synthesis of most chitin in both yeast and hyphae. Three independent chitin assays gave markedly different estimates of the relative chitin content of yeast and hyphae and wild-type and chs mutants. Only one of the methods gave a significantly higher chitin content for hyphal compared to yeast cell walls and a lower chitin content for hyphae of the {$\Delta$}chs2 null mutant compared to the parental strain.},

  abstract = {Screening cDNA libraries with polyclonal antibody preparations against Candida albicans yeast or mycelial cell walls resulted in isolation of several positive clones. Some of them encoded enolase; others encoded a protein of the 70 kDa heat-shock protein family (Hsp70p), etc. The presence of these cytosolic proteins in the cell wall of actively growing C. albicans was discovered by analytical (SDS-PAGE and Western blot) and cytological (indirect immunofluorescence) experiments. Supplementation of cell cultures with papulacandin B, an antibiotic that inhibits formation of the {$\beta$}-glucan skeleton, resulted in the release of enolase to the supernatant fluids; this release was prevented when 0.6 M KCI was present as an osmotic stabilizer. The cell wall of C. albicans incorporated exogenously added proteins (enolase and Escherichia coli and C albicans cytosolic proteins). The presence in the C. albicans cell wall of enolase, Hsp70p, and probably other intracellular proteins that are highly immunogenic might help the fungal cells to evade the host defences, and consequently could represent a survival mechanism for C. albicans `in vivo'.},

  abstract = {Candida albicans is the most common fungal pathogen of humans and has developed an extensive repertoire of putative virulence mechanisms that allows successful colonization and infection of the host under suitable predisposing conditions. Extracellular proteolytic activity plays a central role in Candida pathogenicity and is produced by a family of 10 secreted aspartyl proteinases (Sap proteins). Although the consequences of proteinase secretion during human infections is not precisely known, in vitro, animal, and human studies have implicated the proteinases in C. albicans virulence in one of the following seven ways: (i) correlation between Sap production in vitro and Candida virulence, (ii) degradation of human proteins and structural analysis in determining Sap substrate specificity, (iii) association of Sap production with other virulence processes of C. albicans, (iv) Sap protein production and Sap immune responses in animal and human infections, (v) SAP gene expression during Candida infections, (vi) modulation of C. albicans virulence by aspartyl proteinase inhibitors, and (vii) the use of SAP-disrupted mutants to analyze C. albicans virulence. Sap proteins fulfill a number of specialized functions during the infective process, which include the simple role of digesting molecules for nutrient acquisition, digesting or distorting host cell membranes to facilitate adhesion and tissue invasion, and digesting cells and molecules of the host immune system to avoid or resist antimicrobial attack by the host. We have critically discussed the data relevant to each of these seven criteria, with specific emphasis on how this proteinase family could contribute to Candida virulence and pathogenesis.},

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, dominant negative alleles of YPT1 and SEC4 interrupt secretory traffic at pre- and post-Golgi steps, respectively. We therefore used a dominant negative genetic approach to examine the intracellular trafficking of several proteins associated with virulence or azole resistance. When the dominant negative ypt1(N121I) allele of C. albicans was overexpressed, yellow-fluorescent protein (YFP) tagged forms of two plasma membrane transporters (Cdr1p and Ftr1p) and the vacuolar membrane ABC transporter Mlt1p accumulated in intracellular structures that appeared related to the ER, but localization of Cdc10p and Int1p was unaffected. When the dominant negative sec4(S28N) allele of C. albicans was overexpressed, Cdr1p and Ftr1p
accumulated intracellularly, and localization of Mlt1p, Cdc10p and Int1p was unaffected. These results imply that (i) Cdr1p and Ftr1p are transported to the plasma membrane by the general secretory pathway, (ii) Mlt1p enters the secretory pathway but is diverted to the vacuole at an early post-Golgi step, and (iii) like Cdc10p, Int1p does not enter the general secretory pathway.},

  abstract = {Virulence of Candida is linked with its ability to form biofilms. Once established, biofilm infections are nearly impossible to eradicate. Biofilm cells live immersed in a self-produced matrix, a blend of extracellular biopolymers, many of which are uncharacterized. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the matrix manufactured by Candida albicans both in vitro and in a clinical niche animal model. We further explore the function of matrix components, including the impact on drug resistance. We uncovered components from each of the macromolecular classes (55\% protein, 25\% carbohydrate, 15\% lipid, and 5\% nucleic acid) in the C. albicans biofilm matrix. Three individual polysaccharides were identified and were suggested to interact physically. Surprisingly, a previously identified polysaccharide of functional importance, {$\beta$}-1,3-glucan, comprised only a small portion of the total matrix carbohydrate. Newly described, more abundant polysaccharides included {$\alpha$}-1,2 branched {$\alpha$}-1,6-mannans (87\%) associated with unbranched {$\beta$}-1,6-glucans (13\%) in an apparent mannan-glucan complex (MGCx). Functional matrix proteomic analysis revealed 458 distinct activities. The matrix lipids consisted of neutral glycerolipids (89.1\%), polar glycerolipids (10.4\%), and sphingolipids (0.5\%). Examination of matrix nucleic acid identified DNA, primarily noncoding sequences. Several of the in vitro matrix components, including proteins and each of the polysaccharides, were also present in the matrix of a clinically relevant in vivo biofilm. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis demonstrated interaction of aggregate matrix with the antifungal fluconazole, consistent with a role in drug impedance and contribution of multiple matrix components.
IMPORTANCE This report is the first to decipher the complex and unique macromolecular composition of the Candida biofilm matrix, demonstrate the clinical relevance of matrix components, and show that multiple matrix components are needed for protection from antifungal drugs. The availability of these biochemical analyses provides a unique resource for further functional investigation of the biofilm matrix, a defining trait of this lifestyle.},

  abstract = {The fungal cell wall is a critically important structure that represents a permeability barrier and protective shield. We probed Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans with liposomes containing amphotericin B (AmBisome), with or without 15-nm colloidal gold particles. The liposomes have a diameter of 60 to 80 nm, and yet their mode of action requires them to penetrate the fungal cell wall to deliver amphotericin B to the cell membrane, where it binds to ergosterol. Surprisingly, using cryofixation techniques with electron microscopy, we observed that the liposomes remained intact during transit through the cell wall of both yeast species, even though the predicted porosity of the cell wall (pore size, \textasciitilde{}5.8 nm) is theoretically too small to allow these liposomes to pass through intact. C. albicans mutants with altered cell wall thickness and composition were similar in both their in vitro AmBisome susceptibility and the ability of liposomes to penetrate the cell wall. AmBisome exposed to ergosterol-deficient C. albicans failed to penetrate beyond the mannoprotein-rich outer cell wall layer. Melanization of C. neoformans and the absence of amphotericin B in the liposomes were also associated with a significant reduction in liposome penetration. Therefore, AmBisome can reach cell membranes intact, implying that fungal cell wall viscoelastic properties are permissive to vesicular structures. The fact that AmBisome can transit through chemically diverse cell wall matrices when these liposomes are larger than the theoretical cell wall porosity suggests that the wall is capable of rapid remodeling, which may also be the mechanism for release of extracellular vesicles.
IMPORTANCE AmBisome is a broad-spectrum fungicidal antifungal agent in which the hydrophobic polyene antibiotic amphotericin B is packaged within a 60- to 80-nm liposome. The mode of action involves perturbation of the fungal cell membrane by selectively binding to ergosterol, thereby disrupting membrane function. We report that the AmBisome liposome transits through the cell walls of both Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans intact, despite the fact that the liposome is larger than the theoretical cell wall porosity. This implies that the cell wall has deformable, viscoelastic properties that are permissive to transwall vesicular traffic. These observations help explain the low toxicity of AmBisome, which can deliver its payload directly to the cell membrane without unloading the polyene in the cell wall. In addition, these findings suggest that extracellular vesicles may also be able to pass through the cell wall to deliver soluble and membrane-bound effectors and other molecules to the extracellular space.},

  abstract = {Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for superficial and life-threatening infections in humans. During mucosal infection, C. albicans undergoes a morphological transition from yeast to invasive filamentous hyphae that secrete candidalysin, a 31-amino-acid peptide toxin required for virulence. Candidalysin damages epithelial cell plasma membranes and stimulates the activating protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor c-Fos (via p38\textendash{}mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK]), and the MAPK phosphatase MKP1 (via extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 [ERK1/2]\textendash{}MAPK), which trigger and regulate proinflammatory cytokine responses, respectively. The candidalysin toxin resides as a discrete cryptic sequence within a larger 271-amino-acid parental preproprotein, Ece1p. Here, we demonstrate that kexin-like proteinases, but not secreted aspartyl proteinases, initiate a two-step posttranslational processing of Ece1p to produce candidalysin. Kex2p-mediated proteolysis of Ece1p after Arg61 and Arg93, but not after other processing sites within Ece1p, is required to generate immature candidalysin from Ece1p, followed by Kex1p-mediated removal of a carboxyl arginine residue to generate mature candidalysin. C. albicans strains harboring mutations of Arg61 and/or Arg93 did not secrete candidalysin, were unable to induce epithelial damage and inflammatory responses in vitro, and showed attenuated virulence in vivo in a murine model of oropharyngeal candidiasis. These observations identify enzymatic processing of C. albicans Ece1p by kexin-like proteinases as crucial steps required for candidalysin production and fungal pathogenicity.
IMPORTANCE Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes mucosal infection in millions of individuals worldwide. Successful infection requires the secretion of candidalysin, the first cytolytic peptide toxin identified in any human fungal pathogen. Candidalysin is derived from its parent protein Ece1p. Here, we identify two key amino acids within Ece1p vital for processing and production of candidalysin. Mutations of these residues render C. albicans incapable of causing epithelial damage and markedly reduce mucosal infection in vivo. Importantly, candidalysin production requires two individual enzymatic events. The first involves processing of Ece1p by Kex2p, yielding immature candidalysin, which is then further processed by Kex1p to produce the mature toxin. These observations identify important steps for C. albicans pathogenicity at mucosal surfaces.},

  abstract = {Prions are infectious protein particles that replicate by templating their aggregated state onto soluble protein of the same type. Originally identified as the causative agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, prions in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are epigenetic elements of inheritance that induce phenotypic changes of their host cells. The prototype yeast prion is the translation termination factor Sup35. Prions composed of Sup35 or its modular prion domain NM are heritable and are transmitted vertically to progeny or horizontally during mating. Interestingly, in mammalian cells, protein aggregates derived from yeast Sup35 NM behave as true infectious entities that employ dissemination strategies similar to those of mammalian prions. While transmission is most efficient when cells are in direct contact, we demonstrate here that cytosolic Sup35 NM prions are also released into the extracellular space in association with nanometer-sized membrane vesicles. Importantly, extracellular vesicles are biologically active and are taken up by recipient cells, where they induce self-sustained Sup35 NM protein aggregation. Thus, in mammalian cells, extracellular vesicles can serve as dissemination vehicles for protein-based epigenetic information transfer.
IMPORTANCE Prions are proteinaceous infectious particles that propagate by templating their quaternary structure onto nascent proteins of the same kind. Prions in yeast act as heritable epigenetic elements that can alter the phenotype when transmitted to daughter cells or during mating. Prion activity is conferred by so-called prion domains often enriched in glutamine and asparagine residues. Interestingly, many mammalian proteins also contain domains with compositional similarity to yeast prion domains. We have recently provided a proof-of-principle demonstration that a yeast prion domain also retains its prion activity in mammalian cells. We demonstrate here that cytosolic prions composed of a yeast prion domain are also packaged into extracellular vesicles that transmit the prion phenotype to bystander cells. Thus, proteins with prion-like domains can behave as proteinaceous information molecules that exploit the cellular vesicle trafficking machinery for intercellular long-distance dissemination.},

  abstract = {The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae harbors several prions that constitute powerful models to investigate the mechanisms of epigenetic structural inheritance. [PSI+] is undoubtedly the best-known yeast prion and results from the conversion of the translation termination factor Sup35p into self-perpetuating protein aggregates. Structurally different conformers of Sup35p aggregates can lead to [PSI+] strains with weak or strong prion phenotypes. Yeast prions are faithfully transmitted from mother to daughter cells during cell division, upon cytoplasmic mixing during mating, or when Sup35p fibrils made in test tubes are introduced into spheroplasts. Virtually all living cells in the three domains of life, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, secrete small membrane vesicles in the extracellular space. These extracellular vesicles (EV) have gained increasing interest as vehicles for the intercellular transfer of signaling molecules, nucleic acids, and pathogenic factors, as well as prion-like protein aggregates associated with neurodegenerative diseases. To begin to explore the question of whether EV could represent a natural mean for yeast prion transmission from cell to cell, we purified these extracellular vesicles and assessed whether they contained Sup35p. Here, we show that Sup35p is secreted within EV released in the extracellular medium of yeast cultures. We demonstrate that Sup35p within EV isolated from strong and weak [PSI+] cells is in an infectious prion conformation. Among the possible implications of our work is the possibility of previously unsuspected EV-mediated horizontal cell-to-cell transfer of fungal prions.
IMPORTANCE Most living cells in the three domains of life, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, secrete small membrane vesicles in the extracellular space. These extracellular vesicles (EV) were long viewed as ``trash cans'' by which cells disposed of unwanted macromolecules. EV gained renewed interest as their roles as vehicles for the cell-to-cell transfer of nucleic acids, signaling molecules, and pathogenic factors were recently uncovered. Of particular interest is their proposed role in the prion-like propagation of toxic protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases. Yeasts naturally harbor prion proteins that are excellent models to investigate the mechanisms of formation, propagation, and elimination of self-perpetuating protein aggregates. Here we show for the first time that a yeast prion is secreted within EV in its infectious aggregated state. A major implication of our work is the possibility of EV-mediated horizontal spread of fungal prions.},

  abstract = {The fungal cell wall confers cell morphology and protection against environmental insults. For fungal pathogens, the cell wall is a key immunological modulator and an ideal therapeutic target. Yeast cell walls possess an inner matrix of interlinked {$\beta$}-glucan and chitin that is thought to provide tensile strength and rigidity. Yeast cells remodel their walls over time in response to environmental change, a process controlled by evolutionarily conserved stress (Hog1) and cell integrity (Mkc1, Cek1) signaling pathways. These mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways modulate cell wall gene expression, leading to the construction of a new, modified cell wall. We show that the cell wall is not rigid but elastic, displaying rapid structural realignments that impact survival following osmotic shock. Lactate-grown Candida albicans cells are more resistant to hyperosmotic shock than glucose-grown cells. We show that this elevated resistance is not dependent on Hog1 or Mkc1 signaling and that most cell death occurs within 10 min of osmotic shock. Sudden decreases in cell volume drive rapid increases in cell wall thickness. The elevated stress resistance of lactate-grown cells correlates with reduced cell wall elasticity, reflected in slower changes in cell volume following hyperosmotic shock. The cell wall elasticity of lactate-grown cells is increased by a triple mutation that inactivates the Crh family of cell wall cross-linking enzymes, leading to increased sensitivity to hyperosmotic shock. Overexpressing Crh family members in glucose-grown cells reduces cell wall elasticity, providing partial protection against hyperosmotic shock. These changes correlate with structural realignment of the cell wall and with the ability of cells to withstand osmotic shock.
IMPORTANCE The C. albicans cell wall is the first line of defense against external insults, the site of immune recognition by the host, and an attractive target for antifungal therapy. Its tensile strength is conferred by a network of cell wall polysaccharides, which are remodeled in response to growth conditions and environmental stress. However, little is known about how cell wall elasticity is regulated and how it affects adaptation to stresses such as sudden changes in osmolarity. We show that elasticity is critical for survival under conditions of osmotic shock, before stress signaling pathways have time to induce gene expression and drive glycerol accumulation. Critical cell wall remodeling enzymes control cell wall flexibility, and its regulation is strongly dependent on host nutritional inputs. We also demonstrate an entirely new level of cell wall dynamism, where significant architectural changes and structural realignment occur within seconds of an osmotic shock.},

  abstract = {Invasive growth of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans into tissues promotes disseminated infections in humans. The plasma membrane is essential for pathogenesis because this important barrier mediates morphogenesis and invasive growth, as well as secretion of virulence factors, cell wall synthesis, nutrient import, and other processes. Previous studies showed that the Sur7 tetraspan protein that localizes to MCC (membrane compartment occupied by Can1)/eisosome subdomains of the plasma membrane regulates a broad range of key functions, including cell wall synthesis, morphogenesis, and resistance to copper. Therefore, a distinct tetraspan protein found in MCC/eisosomes, Nce102, was investigated. Nce102 belongs to the MARVEL domain protein family, which is implicated in regulating membrane structure and function. Deletion of NCE102 did not cause the broad defects seen in sur7{$\Delta$} cells. Instead, the nce102{$\Delta$} mutant displayed a unique phenotype in that it was defective in forming hyphae and invading low concentrations of agar but could invade well in higher agar concentrations. This phenotype was likely due to a defect in actin organization that was observed by phalloidin staining. In support of this, the invasive growth defect of a bni1{$\Delta$} mutant that mislocalizes actin due to lack of the Bni1 formin was also reversed at high agar concentrations. This suggests that a denser matrix provides a signal that compensates for the actin defects. The nce102{$\Delta$} mutant displayed decreased virulence and formed abnormal hyphae in mice. These studies identify novel ways that Nce102 and the physical environment surrounding C. albicans regulate morphogenesis and pathogenesis.
IMPORTANCE The plasma membrane promotes virulence of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans by acting as a protective barrier around the cell and mediating dynamic activities, such as morphogenesis, cell wall synthesis, secretion of virulence factors, and nutrient uptake. To better understand how the plasma membrane contributes to virulence, we analyzed a set of eight genes encoding MARVEL family proteins that are predicted to function in membrane organization. Interestingly, deletion of one gene, NCE102, caused a strong defect in formation of invasive hyphal growth in vitro and decreased virulence in mice. The nce102{$\Delta$} mutant cells showed defects in actin organization that underlie the morphogenesis defect, since mutation of a known regulator of actin organization caused a similar defect. These studies identify a novel way in which the plasma membrane regulates the actin cytoskeleton and contributes to pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans causes lethal systemic infections because of its ability to grow and disseminate in a host. The C. albicans plasma membrane is essential for virulence by acting as a protective barrier and through its key roles in interfacing with the environment, secretion of virulence factors, morphogenesis, and cell wall synthesis. Difficulties in studying hydrophobic membranes have limited the understanding of how plasma membrane organization contributes to its function and to the actions of antifungal drugs. Therefore, the role of the recently discovered plasma membrane subdomains termed the membrane compartment containing Can1 (MCC) was analyzed by assessing the virulence of a sur7{$\Delta$} mutant. Sur7 is an integral membrane protein component of the MCC that is needed for proper localization of actin, morphogenesis, cell wall synthesis, and responding to cell wall stress. MCC domains are stable 300-nm-sized punctate patches that associate with a complex of cytoplasmic proteins known as an eisosome. Analysis of virulence-related properties of a sur7{$\Delta$} mutant revealed defects in intraphagosomal growth in macrophages that correlate with increased sensitivity to oxidation and copper. The sur7{$\Delta$} mutant was also strongly defective in pathogenesis in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis. The mutant cells showed a decreased ability to initiate an infection and greatly diminished invasive growth into kidney tissues. These studies on Sur7 demonstrate that the plasma membrane MCC domains are critical for virulence and represent an important new target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
IMPORTANCE Candida albicans, the most common human fungal pathogen, causes lethal systemic infections by growing and disseminating in a host. The plasma membrane plays key roles in enabling C. albicans to grow in vivo, and it is also the target of the most commonly used antifungal drugs. However, plasma membrane organization is poorly understood because of the experimental difficulties in studying hydrophobic components. Interestingly, recent studies have identified a novel type of plasma membrane subdomain in fungi known as the membrane compartment containing Can1 (MCC). Cells lacking the MCC-localized protein Sur7 display broad defects in cellular organization and response to stress in vitro. Consistent with this, C. albicans cells lacking the SUR7 gene were more susceptible to attack by macrophages than cells with the gene and showed greatly reduced virulence in a mouse model of systemic infection. Thus, Sur7 and other MCC components represent novel targets for antifungal therapy.},

  abstract = {Life-threatening systemic infections often occur due to the translocation of pathogens across the gut barrier and into the bloodstream. While the microbial and host mechanisms permitting bacterial gut translocation are well characterized, these mechanisms are still unclear for fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans, a leading cause of nosocomial fungal bloodstream infections. In this study, we dissected the cellular mechanisms of translocation of C. albicans across intestinal epithelia in vitro and identified fungal genes associated with this process. We show that fungal translocation is a dynamic process initiated by invasion and followed by cellular damage and loss of epithelial integrity. A screen of {$>$}2,000 C. albicans deletion mutants identified genes required for cellular damage of and translocation across enterocytes. Correlation analysis suggests that hypha formation, barrier damage above a minimum threshold level, and a decreased epithelial integrity are required for efficient fungal translocation. Translocation occurs predominantly via a transcellular route, which is associated with fungus-induced necrotic epithelial damage, but not apoptotic cell death. The cytolytic peptide toxin of C. albicans, candidalysin, was found to be essential for damage of enterocytes and was a key factor in subsequent fungal translocation, suggesting that transcellular translocation of C. albicans through intestinal layers is mediated by candidalysin. However, fungal invasion and low-level translocation can also occur via non-transcellular routes in a candidalysin-independent manner. This is the first study showing translocation of a human-pathogenic fungus across the intestinal barrier being mediated by a peptide toxin.
IMPORTANCE Candida albicans, usually a harmless fungus colonizing human mucosae, can cause lethal bloodstream infections when it manages to translocate across the intestinal epithelium. This can result from antibiotic treatment, immune dysfunction, or intestinal damage (e.g., during surgery). However, fungal processes may also contribute. In this study, we investigated the translocation process of C. albicans using in vitro cell culture models. Translocation occurs as a stepwise process starting with invasion, followed by epithelial damage and loss of epithelial integrity. The ability to secrete candidalysin, a peptide toxin deriving from the hyphal protein Ece1, is key: C. albicans hyphae, secreting candidalysin, take advantage of a necrotic weakened epithelium to translocate through the intestinal layer.},

Until recently, there was remarkably little information regarding the trans-fungal cell wall transfer of intracellular macromolecules to the extracellular space. Recently, several studies have begun to elucidate the mechanisms that fungal cells utilize to secrete a wide variety of macromolecules through the cell wall. The combined use of transmission electron microscopy, serology, biochemistry, proteomics and lipidomics have revealed that the fungal pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis and Sporothrix schenckii, as well as the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, each produces extracellular vesicles that carry lipids, proteins, polysaccharides and pigment-like structures of unquestionable biological significance. Compositional analysis of the C. neoformans and H. capsulatum extracellular vesicles suggests that they may function as `virulence bags', with the potential to modulate the host-pathogen interaction in favor of the fungus. The cellular origin of the extracellular vesicles remains unknown, but morphological and biochemical features indicate that they are similar to the well-described mammalian exosomes.},

This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

  abstract = {The cell surface and secreted proteins are the initial points of contact between Candida albicans and the host. Improvements in protein extraction approaches and mass spectrometers have allowed researchers to obtain a comprehensive knowledge of these external subproteomes. In this paper, we review the published proteomic studies that have examined C. albicans extracellular proteins, including the cell surface proteins or surfome and the secreted proteins or secretome. The use of different approaches to isolate cell wall and cell surface proteins, such as fractionation approaches or cell shaving, have resulted in different outcomes. Proteins with N-terminal signal peptide, known as classically secreted proteins, and those that lack the signal peptide, known as unconventionally secreted proteins, have been consistently identified. Existing studies on C. albicans extracellular vesicles reveal that they are relevant as an unconventional pathway of protein secretion and can help explain the presence of proteins without a signal peptide, including some moonlighting proteins, in the cell wall and the extracellular environment. According to the global view presented in this review, cell wall proteins, virulence factors such as adhesins or hydrolytic enzymes, metabolic enzymes and stress related-proteins are important groups of proteins in C. albicans surfome and secretome.
Biological significance
Candida albicans extracellular proteins are involved in biofilm formation, cell nutrient acquisition and cell wall integrity maintenance. Furthermore, these proteins include virulence factors and immunogenic proteins. This review is of outstanding interest, not only because it extends knowledge of the C. albicans surface and extracellular proteins that could be related with pathogenesis, but also because it presents insights that may facilitate the future development of new antifungal drugs and vaccines and contributes to efforts to identify new biomarkers that can be employed to diagnose candidiasis. Here, we list more than 570 C. albicans proteins that have been identified in extracellular locations to deliver the most extensive catalogue of this type of proteins to date. Moreover, we describe 16 proteins detected at all locations analysed in the works revised. These proteins include the glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins Ecm33, Pga4 and Phr2 and unconventional secretory proteins such as Eft2, Eno1, Hsp70, Pdc11, Pgk1 and Tdh3. Furthermore, 13 of these 16 proteins are immunogenic and could represent a set of interesting candidates for biomarker discovery.},

  issn = {1874-3919},
  abstract = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs), like exosomes, are small membrane vesicles involved in cell-to-cell communications that modulate numerous biological processes. We previously discovered a new EV subset in milk (sedimenting at 35,000 g; 35 K) that protected its cargo (RNAs and proteins) during simulated digestion and was more enriched in microRNAs than exosomes (sedimenting at 100 K). Here, we used LC-MS/MS to push further the comparison between these two pellets. Commonly used EV markers were not differentially enriched between the pellets, questioning their use with cow's milk EVs. Similarly, the majority of the quantified proteins were equally enriched between the two pellets. Nevertheless, 20 proteins were specific to 35 K, while 41 were specifically enriched in 100 K (p {$<$} 0.05), suggesting their potential use as specific markers. Loaded with these proteins, the EVs in these pellets might regulate translation, proliferation and cell survival for 35 K, and metabolism, extracellular matrix turnover and immunity for 100 K. This approach also brought new insights into milk EV-associated integrins and their possible role in specifically targeting recipient cell types. These findings may help better discriminate between milk EVs, improve our understanding of milk EV-associated protein function and their possible use as therapeutic tools for the management of immunity- and metabolism-associated disorders.

  shorttitle = {Candida Species},
  abstract = {The incidence of fungal infections has increased significantly, so contributing to morbidity and mortality. This is caused by an increase in antimicrobial resistance and the restricted number of antifungal drugs, which retain many side effects. Candida species are major human fungal pathogens that cause both mucosal and deep tissue infections. Recent evidence suggests that the majority of infections produced by this pathogen are associated with biofilm growth. Biofilms are biological communities with a high degree of organization, in which micro-organisms form structured, coordinated and functional communities. These biological communities are embedded in a self-created extracellular matrix. Biofilm production is also associated with a high level of antimicrobial resistance of the associated organisms. The ability of Candida species to form drug-resistant biofilms is an important factor in their contribution to human disease. The study of plants as an alternative to other forms of drug discovery has attracted great attention because, according to the World Health Organization, these would be the best sources for obtaining a wide variety of drugs and could benefit a large population. Furthermore, silver nanoparticles, antibodies and photodynamic inactivation have also been used with good results. This article presents a brief review of the literature regarding the epidemiology of Candida species, as well as their pathogenicity and ability to form biofilms, the antifungal activity of natural products and other therapeutic options.},

  abstract = {Candida infections (candidiasis) are the most prevalent opportunistic fungal infection on humans and, as such, a major public health problem. In recent decades, candidiasis has been associated to Candida species other than Candida albicans. Moreover, biofilms have been considered the most prevalent growth form of Candida cells and a strong causative agent of the intensification of antifungal resistance. As yet, no specific resistance factor has been identified as the sole responsible for the increased recalcitrance to antifungal agents exhibited by biofilms. Instead, biofilm antifungal resistance is a complex multifactorial phenomenon, which still remains to be fully elucidated and understood. The different mechanisms, which may be responsible for the intrinsic resistance of Candida species biofilms, include the high density of cells within the biofilm, the growth and nutrient limitation, the effects of the biofilm matrix, the presence of persister cells, the antifungal resistance gene expression and the increase of sterols on the membrane of biofilm cells. Thus, this review intends to provide information on the recent advances about Candida species biofilm antifungal resistance and its implication on intensification of the candidiasis.},

  abstract = {Candida albicans is an opportunistic microorganism that can become a pathogen causing mild superficial mycosis or more severe invasive infections that can be life-threatening for debilitated patients. In the etiology of invasive infections, key factors are the adaptability of C. albicans to the different niches of the human body and the transition from a yeast form to hypha. Hyphal morphology confers high adhesiveness to the host cells, as well as the ability to penetrate into organs. The cell wall plays a crucial role in the morphological changes C. albicans undergoes in response to specific environmental cues. Among the different categories of enzymes involved in the formation of the fungal cell wall, the GH72 family of transglycosylases plays an important assembly role. These enzymes cut and religate {$\beta$}-(1,3)-glucan, the major determinant of cell shape. In C. albicans, the PHR family encodes GH72 enzymes, some of which work in specific environmental conditions. In this review, we will summarize the work from the initial discovery of PHR genes to the study of the pH-dependent expression of PHR1 and PHR2, from the characterization of the gene products to the recent findings concerning the stress response generated by the lack of GH72 activity in C. albicans hyphae.},

  abstract = {The fungal plasma membrane is critical for cell wall synthesis and other important processes including nutrient uptake, secretion, endocytosis, morphogenesis, and response to stress. To coordinate these diverse functions, the plasma membrane is organized into specialized compartments that vary in size, stability, and composition. One recently identified domain known as the Membrane Compartment of Can1 (MCC)/eisosome is distinctive in that it corresponds to a furrow-like invagination in the plasma membrane. MCC/eisosomes have been shown to be formed by the Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain proteins Lsp1 and Pil1 in a range of fungi. MCC/eisosome domains influence multiple cellular functions; but a very pronounced defect in cell wall synthesis has been observed for mutants with defects in MCC/eisosomes in some yeast species. For example, Candida albicans MCC/eisosome mutants display abnormal spatial regulation of cell wall synthesis, including large invaginations and altered chemical composition of the walls. Recent studies indicate that MCC/eisosomes affect cell wall synthesis in part by regulating the levels of the key regulatory lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2) in the plasma membrane. One general way MCC/eisosomes function is by acting as protected islands in the plasma membrane, since these domains are very stable. They also act as scaffolds to recruit \&gt;20 proteins. Genetic studies aimed at defining the function of the MCC/eisosome proteins have identified important roles in resistance to stress, such as resistance to oxidative stress mediated by the flavodoxin-like proteins Pst1, Pst2, Pst3 and Ycp4. Thus, MCC/eisosomes play multiple roles in plasma membrane organization that protect fungal cells from the environment.},

  abstract = {Several cell types, including tumour cells, secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs), and tumour-derived EVs play a role in cancer initiation and progression. These vesicles include both a common set of membrane and cytosolic proteins and origin-specific subsets of proteins that likely correlated to cell type\textendash{}associated functions. To confirm the presence of EVs in the preparations, researchers have identified so-called EV marker proteins, including the tetraspanin family proteins and such cytosolic proteins as heat shock 70 kDa protein 4 (HSP70) and tumour susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101). However, studies have shown that some EV markers are not always present in all EVs, which not only complicates the identification of EVs but also precludes the quantitative evaluation of EV proteins. Thus, it is strongly required to explore well-conserved EV marker proteins that are present at similar levels, regardless of their tissue or cellular origin. In this study, we compared the presence of 11 well-known EV marker proteins by immunoblotting using EVs isolated from 4 human prostate cell lines and 5 human breast cell lines, including cancer cells with different phenotypes. We found that all the tested EVs were positive for CD9 and CD81, with similar abundance that was irrespective of the EV origin. In contrast, other EV marker proteins, such as TSG101, Rab-5b and CD63, were detected in an inconsistent manner, depending on the origin of the EVs. Thus, we propose that the detection of CD9 and/or CD81 should ensure the presence of EVs.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been recognized as potent vehicles of intercellular communication, both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This is due to their capacity to transfer proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, thereby influencing various physiological and pathological functions of both recipient and parent cells. While intensive investigation has targeted the role of EVs in different pathological processes, for example, in cancer and autoimmune diseases, the EV-mediated maintenance of homeostasis and the regulation of physiological functions have remained less explored. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the physiological roles of EVs, which has been written by crowd-sourcing, drawing on the unique EV expertise of academia-based scientists, clinicians and industry based in 27 European countries, the United States and Australia. This review is intended to be of relevance to both researchers already working on EV biology and to newcomers who will encounter this universal cell biological system. Therefore, here we address the molecular contents and functions of EVs in various tissues and body fluids from cell systems to organs. We also review the physiological mechanisms of EVs in bacteria, lower eukaryotes and plants to highlight the functional uniformity of this emerging communication system.},

  abstract = {Current methods for characterisation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) need further standardisation in order to obtain an acceptable level of data comparability. Size and concentration of EVs can be determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). However, both the heterogeneity of EVs and the choice of instrument settings may cause an appreciable analytical variation. Intra-assay (within-day, n = 6) and inter-assay (day-to-day, n = 6) variations (coefficient of variation, \% CV) of different preparations of EVs and artificial vesicles or beads were determined using two NanoSight NS500 instruments, located at different laboratories. All analyses were performed by the same operator. The effect of applying identical software settings or instrument-optimised settings for each sample type and instrument was also evaluated. Finally, the impact of different operators and the use of two different software versions were investigated. The intra-assay CVs were 1\textendash{}12\% for both EVs and artificial samples, measured on the same instrument. The overall day-to-day variation was similar for both instruments, ranging from 2\% to 25\%. However, significantly different results were observed between the two instruments using identical software settings. The effect of applying instrument-optimised settings reduced the mismatch between the instruments, resulting in little to no significant divergences. The impact of using different operators and software versions when analysing silica microspheres and microvesicles from monocytes using instrument-optimised settings on the same instrument did not contribute to significant variation compared to the overall day-to-day variation of one operator. Performance differences between two similar NTA instruments may display significant divergences in size and concentration measurements when analysing EVs, depending on applied instrument settings and technical conditions. The importance of developing a streamlined and standardised execution of analysis, as well as monitoring longitudinal variation parameters on both biological and synthetic samples, should be highlighted.},

  abstract = {The last decade has seen a sharp increase in the number of scientific publications describing physiological and pathological functions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), a collective term covering various subtypes of cell-released, membranous structures, called exosomes, microvesicles, microparticles, ectosomes, oncosomes, apoptotic bodies, and many other names. However, specific issues arise when working with these entities, whose size and amount often make them difficult to obtain as relatively pure preparations, and to characterize properly. The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) proposed Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (``MISEV'') guidelines for the field in 2014. We now update these ``MISEV2014'' guidelines based on evolution of the collective knowledge in the last four years. An important point to consider is that ascribing a specific function to EVs in general, or to subtypes of EVs, requires reporting of specific information beyond mere description of function in a crude, potentially contaminated, and heterogeneous preparation. For example, claims that exosomes are endowed with exquisite and specific activities remain difficult to support experimentally, given our still limited knowledge of their specific molecular machineries of biogenesis and release, as compared with other biophysically similar EVs. The MISEV2018 guidelines include tables and outlines of suggested protocols and steps to follow to document specific EV-associated functional activities.

The role of this exosome subset in melanoma progression has been of interest ever since ex vivo studies of exosomes produced by melanoma cell lines were shown to suppress anti-melanoma immune responses. To study the impact of melanoma-derived exosomes (MTEX) present in patients' plasma on melanoma progression, isolation of MTEX from total plasma exosomes is necessary. We have developed an immunoaffinity-based method for MTEX capture from plasma of melanoma patients. Using mAb 763.74 specific for the CSPG4 epitope uniquely expressed on melanoma cells, we separated MTEX from non-tumour cell-derived exosomes and evaluated the protein cargo of both fractions by quantitative flow cytometry. Melanoma-associated antigens were carried by MTEX but were not detectable in exosomes produced by normal cells. Separation of plasma-derived MTEX from non-MTEX provides an opportunity for future evaluation of MTEX as potential biomarkers of melanoma progression and as surrogates of melanoma in tumour liquid biopsy studies.},

  abstract = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) provide a complex means of intercellular signalling between cells at local and distant sites, both within and between different organs. According to their cell-type specific signatures, EVs can function as a novel class of biomarkers for a variety of diseases, and can be used as drug-delivery vehicles. Furthermore, EVs from certain cell types exert beneficial effects in regenerative medicine and for immune modulation. Several techniques are available to harvest EVs from various body fluids or cell culture supernatants. Classically, differential centrifugation, density gradient centrifugation, size-exclusion chromatography and immunocapturing-based methods are used to harvest EVs from EV-containing liquids. Owing to limitations in the scalability of any of these methods, we designed and optimised a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based precipitation method to enrich EVs from cell culture supernatants. We demonstrate the reproducibility and scalability of this method and compared its efficacy with more classical EV-harvesting methods. We show that washing of the PEG pellet and the re-precipitation by ultracentrifugation remove a huge proportion of PEG co-precipitated molecules such as bovine serum albumine (BSA). However, supported by the results of the size exclusion chromatography, which revealed a higher purity in terms of particles per milligram protein of the obtained EV samples, PEG-prepared EV samples most likely still contain a certain percentage of other non-EV associated molecules. Since PEG-enriched EVs revealed the same therapeutic activity in an ischemic stroke model than corresponding cells, it is unlikely that such co-purified molecules negatively affect the functional properties of obtained EV samples. In summary, maybe not being the purification method of choice if molecular profiling of pure EV samples is intended, the optimised PEG protocol is a scalable and reproducible method, which can easily be adopted by laboratories equipped with an ultracentrifuge to enrich for functional active EVs.},

  abstract = {BackgroundExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are important mediators of cell-to-cell communication in healthy and pathological environments. Because EVs are present in a variety of biological fluids and contain molecular signatures of their cell or tissue of origin, they have great diagnostic and prognostic value. The ability of EVs to deliver biologically active proteins, RNAs and lipids to cells has generated interest in developing novel therapeutics. Despite their potential medical use, many of the mechanisms underlying EV biogenesis and secretion remain unknown.MethodsHere, we characterized vesicle secretion across the NCI-60 panel of human cancer cells by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Using CellMiner, the quantity of EVs secreted by each cell line was compared to reference transcriptomics data to identify gene products associated with vesicle secretion.ResultsGene products positively associated with the quantity of exosomal-sized vesicles included vesicular trafficking classes of proteins with Rab GTPase function and sphingolipid metabolism. Positive correlates of larger microvesicle-sized vesicle secretion included gene products involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and exocytosis, as well as Rab GTPase activation. One of the identified targets, CD63, was further evaluated for its role in vesicle secretion. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 knockout of the CD63 gene in HEK293 cells resulted in a decrease in small vesicle secretion, suggesting the importance of CD63 in exosome biogenesis.ConclusionThese observations reveal new insights into genes involved in exosome and microvesicle formation, and may provide a means to distinguish EV sub-populations. This study offers a foundation for further exploration of targets involved in EV biogenesis and secretion.},

However, little is known about the relationship of protein and lipid composition of EVs and their source cells. Here, we report high-resolution lipidomic and proteomic analyses of exosomes and MVs derived by differential ultracentrifugation from 3 different cell types: U87 glioblastoma cells, Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells and human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We identified 3,532 proteins and 1,961 lipid species in the screen. Exosomes differed from MVs in several different areas: (a) The protein patterns of exosomes were more likely different from their cells of origin than were the protein patterns of MVs; (b) The proteomes of U87 and Huh7 exosomes were similar to each other but different from the proteomes of MSC exosomes, whereas the lipidomes of Huh7 and MSC exosomes were similar to each other but different from the lipidomes of U87 exosomes; (c) exosomes exhibited proteins of extracellular matrix, heparin-binding, receptors, immune response and cell adhesion functions, whereas MVs were enriched in endoplasmic reticulum, proteasome and mitochondrial proteins. Exosomes and MVs also differed in their types of lipid contents. Enrichment in glycolipids and free fatty acids characterized exosomes, whereas enrichment in ceramides and sphingomyelins characterized MVs. Furthermore, Huh7 and MSC exosomes were specifically enriched in cardiolipins; U87 exosomes were enriched in sphingomyelins. This study comprehensively analyses the protein and lipid composition of exosomes, MVs and source cells in 3 different cell types.},

  abstract = {Classic cell wall components of fungi comprise the polysaccharides glucans and chitin, in association with glycoproteins and pigments. During the last decade, however, system biology approaches clearly demonstrated that the composition of fungal cell walls include atypical molecules historically associated with intracellular or membrane locations. Elucidation of mechanisms by which many fungal molecules are exported to the extracellular space suggested that these atypical components are transitorily located to the cell wall. The presence of extracellular vesicles (EVs) at the fungal cell wall and in culture supernatants of distinct pathogenic species suggested a highly functional mechanism of molecular export in these organisms. Thus, the passage of EVs through fungal cell walls suggests remarkable molecular diversity and, consequently, a potentially variable influence on the host antifungal response. On the basis of information derived from the proteomic characterization of fungal EVs from the yeasts Cryptoccocus neoformans and Candida albicans and the dimorphic fungi Histoplasma capsulatum and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, our manuscript is focused on the clear view that the fungal cell wall is much more complex than previously thought.},

  issn = {1535-3893},
  abstract = {Large-scale quantitative analyses of biological systems are often performed with few replicate experiments, leading to multiple nonidentical data sets due to missing values. For example, mass spectrometry driven proteomics experiments are frequently performed with few biological or technical replicates due to sample-scarcity or due to duty-cycle or sensitivity constraints, or limited capacity of the available instrumentation, leading to incomplete results where detection of significant feature changes becomes a challenge. This problem is further exacerbated for the detection of significant changes on the peptide level, for example, in phospho-proteomics experiments. In order to assess the extent of this problem and the implications for large-scale proteome analysis, we investigated and optimized the performance of three statistical approaches by using simulated and experimental data sets with varying numbers of missing values. We applied three tools, including standard t test, moderated t test, also known as limma, and rank products for the detection of significantly changing features in simulated and experimental proteomics data sets with missing values. The rank product method was improved to work with data sets containing missing values. Extensive analysis of simulated and experimental data sets revealed that the performance of the statistical analysis tools depended on simple properties of the data sets. High-confidence results were obtained by using the limma and rank products methods for analyses of triplicate data sets that exhibited more than 1000 features and more than 50\% missing values. The maximum number of differentially represented features was identified by using limma and rank products methods in a complementary manner. We therefore recommend combined usage of these methods as a novel and optimal way to detect significantly changing features in these data sets. This approach is suitable for large quantitative data sets from stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry experiments and should be applicable to large data sets of any type. An R script that implements the improved rank products algorithm and the combined analysis is available.},

During colonization of the tomato xylem vessels the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol) secretes small proteins that are referred to as SIX (Secreted In Xylem) proteins. Of these, Six1 (Avr3), Six3 (Avr2), Six5 and Six6 are required for full virulence, denoting them as effectors. To investigate their activities in the plant, the xylem sap proteome of plants inoculated with Fol wild-type or either AVR2, AVR3, SIX2, SIX5 or SIX6 knockout strains was analyzed with nano-Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (nLC-MSMS). Compared to mock-inoculated sap 12 additional plant proteins appeared while 45 proteins were no longer detectable in the xylem sap of Fol-infected plants. Of the 285 proteins found in both uninfected and infected plants the abundance of 258 proteins changed significantly following infection. The xylem sap proteome of plants infected with four Fol effector knockout strains differed significantly from plants infected with wild-type Fol, while that of the SIX2-knockout inoculated plants remained unchanged. Besides an altered abundance of a core set of 24 differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs), each of the four effector knockout strains affected specifically the abundance of a subset of DAPs. Hence, Fol effectors have both unique and shared effects on the composition of the tomato xylem sap proteome.},

SGs and granule-related signaling circuits are therefore promising targets to improve therapeutic intervention for several diseases. This is clinically relevant, because pharmacological drugs can affect treatment outcome by modulating SG formation. As membraneless and highly dynamic compartments, SGs regulate translation, ribostasis and proteostasis. Moreover, they serve as signaling hubs that determine cell viability and stress recovery. Various compounds can modulate SG formation and dynamics.

This subset, characterized by extended length and adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich motifs, is highly enriched with genes critical for cell survival and proliferation. This pattern of RG targeting was conserved for two other stress types, heat shock and arsenite toxicity, which induce distinct responses in the total cytoplasmic transcriptome. Nevertheless, stress-specific RG-targeting motifs, such as guanylate-cytidylate (GC)-rich motifs in heat shock, were also identified.

Stress granules are mRNA-protein granules that form when translation initiation is limited, and they are related to pathological granules in various neurodegenerative diseases. Super-resolution microscopy reveals stable substructures, referred to as cores, within stress granules that can be purified. Proteomic analysis of stress granule cores reveals a dense network of protein-protein interactions and links between stress granules and human diseases and identifies ATP-dependent helicases and protein remodelers as~conserved stress granule components. ATP is required for stress granule assembly and dynamics. Moreover, multiple ATP-driven machines affect stress granules differently, with the CCT complex inhibiting stress granule assembly, while the MCM and RVB complexes promote stress granule persistence. Our observations suggest that stress granules contain a stable core structure surrounded by a dynamic shell with assembly, disassembly, and transitions between the core and shell modulated by numerous protein and RNA remodeling complexes.},

Stress granules are mRNA-protein assemblies formed from nontranslating mRNAs. Stress granules are important in the stress response and may contribute to some degenerative diseases. Here, we describe the stress granule transcriptome of~yeast and mammalian cells through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of purified stress granule cores and single-molecule fluorescence in~situ hybridization (smFISH) validation. While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting efficiency varies from {$<$}1\% to {$>$}95\%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability. Quantifying the RNA-seq analysis by smFISH reveals that only 10\% of bulk mRNA molecules accumulate in mammalian stress granules and that only 185 genes have more than 50\% of their~mRNA molecules in stress granules. These results suggest that stress granules may not represent a specific biological program of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) assembly, but instead form by condensation of nontranslating mRNPs in proportion to their length and lack of association with ribosomes.},

SGs have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In ALS and FTD, the majority of cases have no known etiology and exposure to external stress is frequently proposed as a contributor to either disease initiation or the rate of disease progression. Of note, both ALS and FTD are characterized by pathological inclusions, where some well-known SG markers localize with the ALS related proteins TDP-43 and FUS. We propose that TDP-43 and FUS serve as an interface between genetic susceptibility and environmental stress exposure in disease pathogenesis.

Stress granules (SGs) are transient ribonucleoprotein (RNP) aggregates that form during cellular stress and are increasingly implicated in human neurodegeneration. To study the proteome and compositional diversity of SGs in different cell types and in the context of neurodegeneration-linked mutations, we used ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) proximity labeling, mass spectrometry, and immunofluorescence to identify {$\sim$}150 previously unknown human SG components. A highly integrated, pre-existing SG protein interaction network in unstressed cells facilitates rapid coalescence into larger SGs. Approximately 20\% of SG diversity is stress or cell-type dependent, with neuronal SGs displaying a particularly complex repertoire of proteins enriched in chaperones and autophagy factors. Strengthening the link between SGs and neurodegeneration, we demonstrate aberrant dynamics, composition, and subcellular distribution of SGs in cells from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Using three Drosophila ALS/FTD models, we identify SG-associated modifiers of neurotoxicity in~vivo. Altogether, our results highlight SG proteins as central to understanding and ultimately targeting neurodegeneration.},

DJ-1 plays a role in protection from oxidative stress, but how it functions as an ``upstream'' oxidative stress sensor and whether this relates to PD is still unclear. Intriguingly, DJ-1 may act as an RNA binding protein associating with specific mRNA transcripts in the human brain. Moreover, we previously reported that the yeast DJ-1 homolog Hsp31 localizes to stress granules (SGs) after glucose starvation, suggesting a role for DJ-1 in RNA dynamics. Here, we report that DJ-1 interacts with several SG components in mammalian cells and localizes to SGs, as well as P-bodies, upon induction of either osmotic or oxidative stress. By purifying the mRNA associated with DJ-1 in mammalian cells, we detected several transcripts and found that subpopulations of these localize to SGs after stress, suggesting that DJ-1 may target specific mRNAs to mRNP granules. Notably, we find that DJ-1 associates with SGs arising from N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) excitotoxicity in primary neurons and parkinsonism-inducing toxins in dopaminergic cell cultures. Thus, our results indicate that DJ-1 is associated with cytoplasmic RNA granules arising during stress and neurodegeneration, providing a possible link between DJ-1 and RNA dynamics which may be relevant for PD pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {The protein aggregation that occurs in neurodegenerative diseases is classically thought to occur as an undesirable, nonfunctional byproduct of protein misfolding. This model contrasts with the biology of RNA binding proteins, many of which are linked to neurodegenerative diseases. RNA binding proteins use protein aggregation as part of a normal regulated, physiological mechanism controlling protein synthesis. The process of regulated protein aggregation is most evident in formation of stress granules. Stress granules assemble when RNA binding proteins aggregate through their glycine rich domains. Stress granules function to sequester, silence and/or degrade RNA transcripts as part of a mechanism that adapts patterns of local RNA translation to facilitate the stress response. Aggregation of RNA binding proteins is reversible and is tightly regulated through pathways, such as phosphorylation of elongation initiation factor 2{$\alpha$}. Microtubule associated protein tau also appears to regulate stress granule formation. Conversely, stress granule formation stimulates pathological changes associated with tau. In this review, I propose that the aggregation of many pathological, intracellular proteins, including TDP-43, FUS or tau, proceeds through the stress granule pathway. Mutations in genes coding for stress granule associated proteins or prolonged physiological stress, lead to enhanced stress granule formation, which accelerates the pathophysiology of protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases. Over-active stress granule formation could act to sequester functional RNA binding proteins and/or interfere with mRNA transport and translation, each of which might potentiate neurodegeneration. The reversibility of the stress granule pathway also offers novel opportunities to stimulate endogenous biochemical pathways to disaggregate these pathological stress granules, and perhaps delay the progression of disease.},

The exact molecular mechanisms by which FMRP plays a role in translation regulation have remained elusive. The finding of an interaction between FMRP and the RNA interference silencing complex (RISC), a master of translation regulation, has suggested that both regulators could be functionally linked. We investigated here this link, and we show that FMRP exhibits little overlap both physically and functionally with the RISC machinery, excluding a direct impact of FMRP on RISC function. Our data indicate that FMRP and RISC are associated to distinct pools of mRNAs. FMRP, unlike RISC machinery, associates with the pool of mRNAs that eventually goes into stress granules upon cellular stress. Furthermore, we show that FMRP plays a positive role in this process as the lack of FMRP or a point mutant causing a severe fragile X alter stress granule formation. Our data support the proposal that FMRP plays a role in controlling the fate of mRNAs after translation arrest.},

OOPS enables recovery of RBPs and free protein, or protein-bound RNA and free RNA, from a single sample in an unbiased manner. By applying OOPS to human cell lines, we extract the majority of known RBPs, and importantly identify additional novel RBPs, including those from previously under-represented cellular compartments. The high yield and unbiased nature of OOPS facilitates its application in both dynamic and inaccessible systems. Thus, we have identified changes in RNA-protein interactions in mammalian cells following nocodazole cell-cycle arrest, and defined the first bacterial RNA-interactome.

  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {The RNA-binding protein Fragile X Mental Retardation (FMRP) is an evolutionarily conserved protein that is particularly abundant in the brain due to its high expression in neurons. FMRP deficiency causes fragile X mental retardation syndrome. In neurons, FMRP controls the translation of target mRNAs in part by promoting dynamic transport in and out neuronal RNA granules. We and others have previously shown that upon stress, mammalian FMRP dissociates from translating polysomes to localize into neuronal-like granules termed stress granules (SG). This localization of FMRP in SG is conserved in Drosophila. Whether FMRP plays a key role in SG formation, how FMRP is recruited into SG, and whether its association with SG is dynamic are currently unknown. In contrast with mammalian FMRP, which has two paralog proteins, Drosophila FMR1 (dFMRP) is encoded by a single gene that has no paralog. Using this genetically simple model, we assessed the role of dFMRP in SG formation and defined the determinants required for its recruitment in SG as well as its dynamics in SG. We show that dFMRP is dispensable for SG formation in vitro and ex vivo. FRAP experiments showed that dFMRP shuttles in and out SG. The shuttling activity of dFMRP is mediated by a protein-protein interaction domain located at the N-terminus of the protein. This domain is, however, dispensable for the localization of dFMRP in SG. This localization of dFMRP in SG requires the KH and RGG motifs which are known to mediate RNA binding, as well as the C-terminal glutamine/asparagine rich domain. Our studies thus suggest that the mechanisms controlling the recruitment of FMRP into SG and those that promote its shuttling between granules and the cytosol are uncoupled. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the regulated shuttling activity of a SG component between RNA granules and the cytosol.},

Despite the various approaches available, there is no consensus with respect to the best methodology for isolating exosomes and to provide substantial yields with reliable quality. Differential centrifugation is the most commonly used method but it is time-consuming and requires large sample volumes, thus alternative methods are urgently needed. In this study two precipitation-based methods and one column-based approach were compared for exosome isolation from distinct biofluids (serum, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid). Exosome characterization included morphological analyses, determination of particle concentration, stability and exosome preparations' purity, using different complementary approaches such as Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, Electrophoretic Light Scattering, Transmission Electron Microscopy, EXOCET colorimetric assay, protein quantification methods and western blotting. The three commercial kits tested successfully isolated exosomes from the biofluids under study, although ExoS showed the best performance in terms of exosome yield and purity. Data shows that methods other than differential centrifugation can be applied to quickly and efficiently isolate exosomes from reduced biofluid volumes. The possibility to use small volumes is fundamental in the context of translational and clinical research, thus the results here presented contribute significantly in this respect.},

  abstract = {The canonical molecular machinery required for global mRNA translation and its control has been well defined, with distinct sets of proteins involved in the processes of translation initiation, elongation and termination. Additionally, noncanonical, trans-acting regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are necessary to provide mRNA-specific translation, and these interact with 5{${'}$} and 3{${'}$} untranslated regions and coding regions of mRNA to regulate ribosome recruitment and transit. Recently it has also been demonstrated that trans-acting ribosomal proteins direct the translation of specific mRNAs. Importantly, it has been shown that subsets of RBPs often work in concert, forming distinct regulatory complexes upon different cellular perturbation, creating an RBP combinatorial code, which through the translation of specific subsets of mRNAs, dictate cell fate. With the development of new methodologies, a plethora of novel RNA binding proteins have recently been identified, although the function of many of these proteins within mRNA translation is unknown. In this review we will discuss these methodologies and their shortcomings when applied to the study of translation, which need to be addressed to enable a better understanding of trans-acting translational regulatory proteins. Moreover, we discuss the protein domains that are responsible for RNA binding as well as the RNA motifs to which they bind, and the role of trans-acting ribosomal proteins in directing the translation of specific mRNAs.

A panel of oat peptides was assessed using multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry to define peptide markers that were unique to oats but were present in all 22 oat cultivars. The method was successfully applied to: (1) the detection of oat contamination in spelt, rice, rye, and buckwheat flours; and (2) the analysis of 7 highly processed commercial food products. The oat peptide markers were detected at high levels in a breakfast cereal and a muesli where oats were a named ingredient, but the presence of oats was also noted in 3 of the 5 breakfast cereals where oats were not named as an ingredient.

  abstract = {Defensins are a large family of small, cationic, cysteine-rich proteins that are part of the defense arsenal that plants use for protection against potentially damaging fungal infections. The plant defensin NaD1 from Nicotiana alata is a potent antifungal protein that inhibits growth and kills a variety of fungal pathogens that affect both plant and animal (human) hosts. Some serine protease inhibitors have also been reported to be antifungal molecules, while others have no inhibitory activity against fungi. Here we describe the synergistic activity of the plant defensin NaD1 with a selection of serine protease inhibitors against the plant pathogens Fusarium graminearum and Colletotrichum graminicola and the animal pathogen Candida albicans. The synergistic activity was not related to the protease inhibitory activity of these molecules but may arise from activation of fungal stress response pathways. The bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) displayed the most synergy with NaD1. BPTI also acted synergistically with several other antifungal molecules. The observation that NaD1 acts synergistically with protease inhibitors provides the foundation for the design of transgenic plants with improved resistance to fungal disease. It also supports the possibility of naturally occurring accessory factors that function to enhance the activity of innate immunity peptides in biological systems.
IMPORTANCE This work describes the increased activity of a natural antifungal peptide in the presence of another antifungal peptide from a different family. This is termed antifungal synergy. Synergy is important for decreasing the amount of antifungal molecule needed to control the disease. Traditionally, naturally occurring antifungal molecules are assayed in isolation. Identification of synergistic interactions between antifungal peptides means that their activities in a complex biological system are likely to be different from what we observe when examining them individually. This study identified synergy between an antifungal peptide and a group of peptides that do not affect fungal growth in vitro. This provides the foundation for generation of transgenic plants with increased resistance to fungal disease and identification of antifungal accessory factors that enhance the activity of innate immune molecules but do not have an antifungal effect on their own.},

  abstract = {The human fungal pathogens Candida albicans and Histoplasma capsulatum have been reported to protect against the oxidative burst of host innate immune cells using a family of extracellular proteins with similarity to Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). We report here that these molecules are widespread throughout fungi and deviate from canonical SOD1 at the primary, tertiary, and quaternary levels. The structure of C. albicans SOD5 reveals that although the {$\beta$}-barrel of Cu/Zn SODs is largely preserved, SOD5 is a monomeric copper protein that lacks a zinc-binding site and is missing the electrostatic loop element proposed to promote catalysis through superoxide guidance. Without an electrostatic loop, the copper site of SOD5 is not recessed and is readily accessible to bulk solvent. Despite these structural deviations, SOD5 has the capacity to disproportionate superoxide with kinetics that approach diffusion limits, similar to those of canonical SOD1. In cultures of C. albicans, SOD5 is secreted in a disulfide-oxidized form and apo-pools of secreted SOD5 can readily capture extracellular copper for rapid induction of enzyme activity. We suggest that the unusual attributes of SOD5-like fungal proteins, including the absence of zinc and an open active site that readily captures extracellular copper, make these SODs well suited to meet challenges in zinc and copper availability at the host\textendash{}pathogen interface.},

This protein is known to be involved in fungal cell wall integrity and is also critical for normal virulence in the mouse model of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis, but its function remains unknown. In this work, several phenotypic analyses of the C. albicans ecm33/ecm33 mutant (RML2U) were performed. We observed that RML2U displays the inability of protoplast to regenerate the cell wall, activation of the cell wall integrity pathway, hypersensitivity to temperature, osmotic and oxidative stresses and a shortened chronological lifespan. During the exponential and stationary culture phases, nuclear and actin staining revealed the possible arrest of the cell cycle in RML2U cells. Interestingly, a "veil growth", never previously described in C. albicans, was serendipitously observed under static stationary cells. The cells that formed this structure were also observed in cornmeal liquid cultures. These cells are giant, round cells, without DNA, and contain large vacuoles, similar to autophagic cells observed in other fungi. Furthermore, RML2U was phagocytozed more than the wild-type strain by macrophages at earlier time points, but the damage caused to the mouse cells was less than with the wild-type strain. Additionally, the percentage of RML2U apoptotic cells after interaction with macrophages was fewer than in the wild-type strain.},

Here we investigated the molecular basis of C. albicans epithelial interactions. By systematically assessing the contributions of defined fungal pathways and factors to different stages of epithelial interactions, we provide an expansive portrait of the processes and activities involved in epithelial infection. We strengthen the concept that hyphal formation is critical for epithelial invasion. Importantly, our data support a model whereby initial epithelial invasion per se does not elicit host damage, but that C. albicans relies on a combination of contact-sensing, directed hyphal extension, active penetration and the expression of novel pathogenicity factors for further inter-epithelial invasion, dissemination and ultimate damage of host cells. Finally, we explore the transcriptional landscape of C. albicans during the early stages of epithelial interaction, and, via genetic analysis, identify ICL1 and PGA34 as novel oral epithelial pathogenicity factors.},

  abstract = {It has been previously shown that inhaled zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) can modulate inflammation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) enclosed in exosomes have been identified as an important signature for inflammatory responses. However, the role of exosomal miRNAs during pathogenic inflammation has not been investigated. Healthy rats were exposed to ZnO-NPs (41.7 nm; 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg) or saline (control) via oropharyngeal aspiration. ZnO-NPs induced significant increases in the serum levels of interleukin 8 (IL-8), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1{$\beta$}), and tumor necrosis factor {$\alpha$} (TNF-{$\alpha$}), and elevated the number of cells and the percentage of neutrophils in the blood. Moreover, exposure to ZnO-NPs increased the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Differential profiling of miRNAs in isolated serum exosomes revealed that 16 miRNAs were up-regulated and 7 down-regulated in ZnO-NP-treated rats compared with the controls. Functional and pathway analysis indicated that miRNAs may participate in inflammation directly and indirectly through protein and vesicle-mediated transport or regulation of IL-1, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy. These results suggest that miRNAs in serum exosomes are involved in pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation induced by ZnO-NPs.},

Analyzing peptide mixtures by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has emerged as the main technology for in-depth proteome analysis whereas two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, low-resolution MALDI, and protein arrays are playing niche roles. MS-based proteomics is rapidly becoming quantitative through both label-free and stable isotope labeling technologies. The latest generation of mass spectrometers combines extremely high resolving power, mass accuracy, and very high sequencing speed in routine proteomic applications. Peptide fragmentation is mostly performed in low-resolution but very sensitive and fast linear ion traps. However, alternative fragmentation methods and high-resolution fragment analysis are becoming much more practical. Recent advances in computational proteomics are removing the data analysis bottleneck. Thus, in a few specialized laboratories, ``precision proteomics'' can now identify and quantify almost all fragmented peptide peaks. Huge challenges and opportunities remain in technology development for proteomics; thus, this is not ``the beginning of the end'' but surely ``the end of the beginning.''},

  abstract = {Candida albicans, the major human fungal pathogen, undergoes a reversible morphological transition from single yeast cells to pseudohyphal and hyphal filaments (elongated cells attached end-to-end). Because typical C. albicans infections contain a mixture of these morphologies it has, for many years, been difficult to assess the relative contribution of each form to virulence. In addition, the regulatory mechanisms that determine growth in pseudohyphal and hyphal morphologies are largely unknown. To address these questions we have generated a C. albicans strain that can be genetically manipulated to grow completely in the hyphal form under non-filament-inducing conditions in vitro. This was achieved by inducing high-level constitutive expression of UME6, a recently identified filament-specific transcriptional regulator of C. albicans hyphal extension. We show that high-level UME6 expression significantly increases hyphal formation and promotes virulence in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis. Our results strongly suggest that shifting the morphology of a C. albicans population toward the hyphal form, and/or increasing hyphal-specific gene expression, during the course of infection is sufficient to improve virulence potential. We also demonstrate that lower levels of UME6 expression specify growth largely in the pseudohyphal form and that increasing UME6 levels is sufficient to cause cells to gradually shift from pseudohyphal to hyphal morphology. In addition, we show that UME6 levels differentially induce the expression of several known filament-specific transcripts. These findings suggest that a common transcriptional regulatory mechanism functions to specify both pseudohyphal and hyphal morphologies in a dosage-dependent manner.},

  volume = {6},

  abstract = {Candida albicans is the major fungal pathogen of humans. Its adhesion to host-cell surfaces is the first critical step during mucosal infection. Antimicrobial peptides play important roles in the first line of mucosal immunity against C. albicans infection. LL-37 is the only member of the human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide family and is commonly expressed in various tissues, including epithelium. We previously showed that LL-37 significantly reduced C. albicans adhesion to plastic, oral epidermoid OECM-1 cells, and urinary bladders of female BALB/c mice. The inhibitory effect of LL-37 on cell adhesion occurred via the binding of LL-37 to cell-wall carbohydrates. Here we showed that formation of LL-37\textendash{}cell-wall protein complexes potentially inhibits C. albicans adhesion to polystyrene. Using phage display and ELISA, we identified 10 peptide sequences that could bind LL-37. A BLAST search revealed that four sequences in the major C. albicans cell-wall {$\beta$}-1,3-exoglucanase, Xog1p, were highly similar to the consensus sequence derived from the 10 biopanned peptides. One Xog1p-derived peptide, Xog1p90\textendash{}115, and recombinant Xog1p associated with LL-37, thereby reversing the inhibitory effect of LL-37 on C. albicans adhesion. LL-37 reduced Xog1p activity and thus interrupted cell-wall remodeling. Moreover, deletion of XOG1 or another {$\beta$}-1,3-exoglucanase-encoding gene EXG2 showed that only when XOG1 was deleted did cellular exoglucanase activity, cell adhesion and LL-37 binding decrease. Antibodies against Xog1p also decreased cell adhesion. These data reveal that Xog1p, originally identified from LL-37 binding, has a role in C. albicans adhesion to polystyrene and, by inference, attach to host cells via direct or indirect manners. Compounds that target Xog1p might find use as drugs that prevent C. albicans infection. Additionally, LL-37 could potentially be used to screen for other cell-wall components involved in fungal cell adhesion.},

  abstract = {The adhesive phenotype of Candida albicans contributes to its ability to colonize the host and cause disease. Als proteins are one of the most widely studied C. albicans virulence attributes; deletion of ALS3 produces the greatest reduction in adhesive function. Although adhesive activity is thought to reside within the N-terminal domain of Als proteins (NT-Als), the molecular mechanism of adhesion remains unclear. We designed mutations in NT-Als3 that test the contribution of the peptide-binding cavity (PBC) to C. albicans adhesion and assessed the adhesive properties of other NT-Als3 features in the absence of a functional PBC. Structural analysis of purified loss-of-PBC-function mutant proteins showed that the mutations did not alter the overall structure or surface properties of NT-Als3. The mutations were incorporated into full-length ALS3 and integrated into the ALS3 locus of a deletion mutant, under control of the native ALS3 promoter. The PBC mutant phenotype was evaluated in assays using monolayers of human pharyngeal epithelial and umbilical vein endothelial cells, and freshly collected human buccal epithelial cells in suspension. Loss of PBC function resulted in an adhesion phenotype that was indistinguishable from the {$\Delta$}als3/{$\Delta$}als3 strain. The adhesive contribution of the Als3 amyloid-forming-region (AFR) was also tested using these methods. C. albicans strains producing cell surface Als3 in which the amyloidogenic potential was destroyed showed little contribution of the AFR to adhesion, instead suggesting an aggregative function for the AFR. Collectively, these results demonstrate the essential and principal role of the PBC in Als3 adhesion.},

  abstract = {Candida albicans triggers recurrent infections of the oropharyngeal mucosa that result from biofilm growth. Prior studies have indicated that the transcription factor Bcr1 regulates biofilm formation in a catheter model, both in vitro and in vivo. We thus hypothesized that Bcr1 plays similar roles in the formation of oral mucosal biofilms and tested this hypothesis in a mouse model of oral infection. We found that a bcr1/bcr1 mutant did not form significant biofilm on the tongues of immunocompromised mice, in contrast to reference and reconstituted strains that formed pseudomembranes covering most of the tongue dorsal surface. Overexpression of HWP1, which specifies an epithelial adhesin that is under the transcriptional control of Bcr1, partly but significantly rescued the bcr1/bcr1 biofilm phenotype in vivo. Since HWP1 overexpression only partly reversed the biofilm phenotype, we investigated whether additional mechanisms, besides adhesin down-regulation, were responsible for the reduced virulence of this mutant. We discovered that the bcr1/bcr1 mutant was more susceptible to damage by human leukocytes when grown on plastic or on the surface of a human oral mucosa tissue analogue. Overexpression of HYR1, but not HWP1, significantly rescued this phenotype. Furthermore a hyr1/hyr1 mutant had significantly attenuated virulence in the mouse oral biofilm model of infection. These discoveries show that Bcr1 is critical for mucosal biofilm infection via regulation of epithelial cell adhesin and neutrophil function.},

Microvesicles, ectosomes, shedding vesicles, microparticles and exosomes are the most common terms to refer to the different kinds of EVs based on their origin, composition, size and density. Exosomes have an endosomal origin and are released by many different cell types, participating in different physiological and/or pathological processes. Depending on their origin, they can alter the fate of recipient cells according to the information transferred. In the last two decades, EVs have become the focus of many studies because of their putative use as non-invasive biomarkers and their potential in bioengineering and clinical applications. In order to exploit this ability of EVs many aspects of their biology should be deciphered. Here, we review the mechanisms involved in EV biogenesis, assembly, recruitment of selected proteins and genetic material as well as the uptake mechanisms by target cells in an effort to understand EV functions and their utility in clinical applications. In these contexts, the role of proteins from the tetraspanin superfamily, which are among the most abundant membrane proteins of EVs, will be highlighted.},

  abstract = {Background The epidemiology of candidemia varies depending on the geographic region. Little is known about the epidemiology of candidemia in Latin America. Methods We conducted a 24-month laboratory-based survey of candidemia in 20 centers of seven Latin American countries. Incidence rates were calculated and the epidemiology of candidemia was characterized. Results Among 672 episodes of candidemia, 297 (44.2\%) occurred in children (23.7\% younger than 1 year), 36.2\% in adults between 19 and 60 years old and 19.6\% in elderly patients. The overall incidence was 1.18 cases per 1,000 admissions, and varied across countries, with the highest incidence in Colombia and the lowest in Chile. Candida albicans (37.6\%), C. parapsilosis (26.5\%) and C. tropicalis (17.6\%) were the leading agents, with great variability in species distribution in the different countries. Most isolates were highly susceptible to fluconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B and anidulafungin. Fluconazole was the most frequent agent used as primary treatment (65.8\%), and the overall 30-day survival was 59.3\%. Conclusions This first large epidemiologic study of candidemia in Latin America showed a high incidence of candidemia, high percentage of children, typical species distribution, with C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis accounting for the majority of episodes, and low resistance rates.},

Candida albicans is the most prevalent fungal species of the human microbiota; this species asymptomatically colonizes many areas of the body, particularly the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts of healthy individuals. Alterations in host immunity, stress, resident microbiota, and other factors can lead to C. albicans overgrowth, causing a wide range of infections, from superficial mucosal to hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. To date, most studies of C. albicans have been carried out in suspension cultures; however, the medical impact of C. albicans (like that of many other microorganisms) depends on its ability to thrive as a biofilm, a closely packed community of cells. Biofilms are notorious for forming on implanted medical devices, including catheters, pacemakers, dentures, and prosthetic joints, which provide a surface and sanctuary for biofilm growth. C. albicans biofilms are intrinsically resistant to conventional antifungal therapeutics, the host immune system, and other environmental perturbations, making biofilm-based infections a significant clinical challenge. Here, we review our current knowledge of biofilms formed by C. albicans and closely related fungal species.},

More recently, the finding that exosomes carry genetic materials, mRNA and miRNA, has been a major breakthrough in the field, unveiling their capacity to vehicle genetic messages. It is now clear that not only immune cells but probably all cell types are able to secrete exosomes: their range of possible functions expands well beyond immunology to neurobiology, stem cell and tumor biology, and their use in clinical applications as biomarkers or as therapeutic tools is an extensive area of research. Despite intensive efforts to understand their functions, two issues remain to be solved in the future: (i) what are the physiological function(s) of exosomes in vivo and (ii) what are the relative contributions of exosomes and of other secreted membrane vesicles in these proposed functions? Here, we will focus on the current ideas on exosomes and immune responses, but also on their mechanisms of secretion and the use of this knowledge to elucidate the latter issue.},

  abstract = {Fungal infections are on the rise, with mortality above 30\% in patients with septic Candida infections. Mutants lacking V-ATPase activity are avirulent and fail to acidify endomembrane compartments, exhibiting pleiotropic defects in secretory, endosomal, and vacuolar pathways. However, the individual contribution of organellar acidification to virulence and its associated traits is not known. To dissect their separate roles in Candida albicans pathogenicity we generated knock-out strains for the V0 subunit a genes VPH1 and STV1, which target the vacuole and secretory pathway, respectively. While the two subunits were redundant in many vma phenotypes, such as alkaline pH sensitivity, calcium homeostasis, respiratory defects, and cell wall integrity, we observed a unique contribution of VPH1. Specifically, vph1{$\Delta$} was defective in acidification of the vacuole and its dependent functions, such as metal ion sequestration as evidenced by hypersensitivity to Zn2+ toxicity, whereas stv1{$\Delta$} resembled wild type. In growth conditions that elicit morphogenic switching, vph1{$\Delta$} was defective in forming hyphae whereas stv1{$\Delta$} was normal or only modestly impaired. Host cell interactions were evaluated in vitro using the Caco-2 model of intestinal epithelial cells, and murine macrophages. Like wild type, stv1{$\Delta$} was able to inflict cellular damage in Caco-2 and macrophage cells, as assayed by LDH release, and escape by filamentation. In contrast, vph1{$\Delta$} resembled a vma7{$\Delta$} mutant, with significant attenuation in host cell damage. Finally, we show that VPH1 is required for fungal virulence in a murine model of systemic infection. Our results suggest that vacuolar acidification has an essential function in the ability of C. albicans to form hyphae and establish infection.},

Specific markers for the analysis and isolation of different EV populations are missing, imposing important limitations to understanding EV functions. Here, EVs from human dendritic cells were first separated by their sedimentation speed, and then either by their behavior upon upward floatation into iodixanol gradients or by immuno-isolation. Extensive quantitative proteomic analysis allowing comparison of the isolated populations showed that several classically used exosome markers, like major histocompatibility complex, flotillin, and heat-shock 70-kDa proteins, are similarly present in all EVs. We identified proteins specifically enriched in small EVs, and define a set of five protein categories displaying different relative abundance in distinct EV populations. We demonstrate the presence of exosomal and nonexosomal subpopulations within small EVs, and propose their differential separation by immuno-isolation using either CD63, CD81, or CD9.

Both LGALS-11 and LGALS-14 bound more putative protein targets in the adult stage of H. contortus (43 proteins) when compared to the larval stage (two proteins). Of the 43 proteins identified in the adult stage, 34 and 35 proteins were bound by LGALS-11 and LGALS-14, respectively, with 26 proteins binding to both galectins. Interestingly, hematophagous stage-specific sperm-coating protein and zinc metalloprotease (M13), which are known vaccine candidates, were identified as putative ligands of both LGALS-11 and LGALS-14. The identification of glycoproteins of H. contortus by LGALS-11 and LGALS-14 provide new insights into host-parasite interactions and the potential for developing new interventions.},

  abstract = {A key step in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is the identification of peptides in sequence databases by their fragmentation spectra. Here we describe Andromeda, a novel peptide search engine using a probabilistic scoring model. On proteome data, Andromeda performs as well as Mascot, a widely used commercial search engine, as judged by sensitivity and specificity analysis based on target decoy searches. Furthermore, it can handle data with arbitrarily high fragment mass accuracy, is able to assign and score complex patterns of post-translational modifications, such as highly phosphorylated peptides, and accommodates extremely large databases. The algorithms of Andromeda are provided. Andromeda can function independently or as an integrated search engine of the widely used MaxQuant computational proteomics platform and both are freely available at www.maxquant.org. The combination enables analysis of large data sets in a simple analysis workflow on a desktop computer. For searching individual spectra Andromeda is also accessible via a web server. We demonstrate the flexibility of the system by implementing the capability to identify cofragmented peptides, significantly improving the total number of identified peptides.},

  abstract = {The salivary apparatus of the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) has been the subject of biochemical study for over a century. A combination of bioassays, behavioral studies and molecular analysis on O.~vulgaris and related species suggests that its proteome should contain a mixture of highly potent neurotoxins and degradative proteins. However, a lack of genomic and transcriptomic data has meant that the amino acid sequences of these proteins remain almost entirely unknown. To address this, we assembled the posterior salivary gland transcriptome of O.~vulgaris and combined it with high resolution mass spectrometry data from the posterior and anterior salivary glands of two adults, the posterior salivary glands of six paralarvae and the saliva from a single adult. We identified a total of 2810 protein groups from across this range of salivary tissues and age classes, including 84 with homology to known venom protein families. Additionally, we found 21 short secreted cysteine rich protein groups of which 12 were specific to cephalopods. By combining protein expression data with phylogenetic analysis we demonstrate that serine proteases expanded dramatically within the cephalopod lineage and that cephalopod specific proteins are strongly associated with the salivary apparatus.},

Exosomes are important regulators of the cellular niche, and their altered characteristics in many diseases, such as cancer, suggest their importance for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, and as drug delivery vehicles. Exosomes have been purified from biological fluids and in vitro cell cultures using a variety of strategies and techniques. In this chapter, we reveal the protocol and key insights into the isolation, purification and characterization of exosomes, distinct from shed microvesicles and apoptotic blebs. Using the colorectal cancer cell line LIM1863 as a cell model, a comprehensive evaluation of exosome isolation methods including ultracentrifugation (UC-Exos), OptiPrep\texttrademark{} density-based separation (DG-Exos), and immunoaffinity capture using anti-EpCAM-coated magnetic beads (IAC-Exos) were examined. All exosome isolation methodologies contained 40\textendash{}150 nm vesicles based on electron microscopy, and positive for exosome markers (Alix, TSG101, HSP70) based on immunoblotting. This protocol employed a proteomic profiling approach to characterize the protein composition of exosomes, and label-free spectral counting to evaluate the effectiveness of each method in exosome isolation. Based on the number of MS/MS spectra identified for exosome markers and proteins associated with their biogenesis, trafficking, and release, IAC-Exos was shown to be the most effective method to isolate exosomes. However, the use of density-based separation (DG-Exos) provides significant advantages for exosome isolation when the use of immunoaffinity capture is limited (due to antibody availability and suitability of exosome markers).},

The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) constitute hetero-oligomeric machines that mediate topologically similar membrane-sculpting processes, including cytokinesis, retroviral egress, and multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis. Although ESCRT-III drives membrane remodeling that creates MVBs, its structure and the mechanism of vesicle formation are unclear. Using electron microscopy, we visualize an ESCRT-II:ESCRT-III supercomplex and propose how it mediates vesicle formation. We define conformational changes that activate ESCRT-III subunit Snf7 and show that it assembles into spiraling {$\sim$}9~nm protofilaments on lipid monolayers. A high-content flow cytometry assay further demonstrates that mutations halting ESCRT-III assembly block ESCRT function. Strikingly, the addition of Vps24 and Vps2 transforms flat Snf7 spirals into membrane-sculpting helices. Finally, we show that ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III coassemble into {$\sim$}65~nm diameter rings indicative of a cargo-sequestering supercomplex. We propose that ESCRT-III has distinct architectural stages that are modulated by ESCRT-II to mediate cargo capture and vesicle formation by ordered assembly.},

Our analysis suggests that the superfamily can be divided into four large families. These four families\textendash{}the CD family, CD63 family, uroplakin family, and RDS family\textendash{}are further classified as consisting of several ortholog groups. The clustering of several ortholog groups together, such as the CD9/Tsp2/CD81 cluster, suggests functional relatedness of those ortholog groups. The fact that our studies are based on whole genome analysis enabled us to estimate not only the phylogenetic relationships among the tetraspanins, but also the first appearance in the tree of life of certain tetraspanin ortholog groups. Taken together, our data suggest that the tetraspanins are derived from a single (or a few) ancestral gene(s) through sequence divergence, rather than convergence, and that the majority of tetraspanins found in the human genome are vertebrate (21 instances), tetrapod (4 instances), or mammalian (6 instances) inventions.},

The disease has a worldwide distribution, with endemic areas in Brazil, and is caused by a complex of species, including Sporothrix brasiliensis. Some fungi release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can interact with the host cell and modulate the host immune response. The aim of this study was to analyze the participation of S. brasiliensis EVs in the modulation of dendritic cells (DCs) and in the control of infection in vivo. Our results showed that in vitro, the EVs isolated from S. brasiliensis induced an increase in the phagocytic index and fungal burden in DCs. In addition, we observed a significant increase in IL-12p40 and TNF-{$\alpha$} cytokine production. Then, the EVs were inoculated into BALB/c mice before subcutaneous infection with yeast, and the lesion was analyzed after 21, 35 and 42 days. An increase in fungal burden and lesion diameter were observed after 21 days in mice inoculated with a high concentration of EVs. However, after 35 days, we observed a regression of the lesion, which persisted until 42 days after infection. Interestingly, we observed an increase in fungal burden in these mice. In addition, we observed the presence of immunogenic components and proteins that could be related with virulence in EVs. These results suggest that EVs can play an important role in virulence and modulation of the host immune system during experimental S. brasiliensis infection.},

For the export of several biomolecules in diverse species, the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is considered to represent an alternative transport mechanism, but no study to date has investigated EVs from dermatophytes. Here, we describe biologically active EVs from the dermatophyte Trichophyton interdigitale, a causative agent of mycoses worldwide. EV preparations from T. interdigitale were examined using nanoparticle-tracking analysis, which revealed vesicular structures 20\textendash{}380 nm in diameter. These vesicles induced the production of proinflammatory mediators by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner, and an addition of the EVs to BMDMs also stimulated the transcription of the M1-polarization marker iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) and diminished the expression of the M2 markers arginase-1 and Ym-1. The observed M1 macrophages' polarization triggered by EVs was abolished in cells obtained from knockout Toll-like receptor-2 mice. Also, the EVs-induced productions of pro-inflammatory mediators were blocked too. Furthermore, the EVs from T. interdigitale enhanced the fungicidal activity of BMDMs. These results suggest that EVs from T. interdigitale can modulate the innate immune response of the host and influence the interaction between T. interdigitale and host immune cells. Our findings thus open new areas of investigation into the host-parasite relationship in dermatophytosis.},

  abstract = {Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is the most common fungal disease in the central nervous system. The mechanisms by which Cryptococcus neoformans invades the brain are largely unknown. In this study, we found that C. neoformans-derived microvesicles (CnMVs) can enhance the traversal of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by C. neoformans in vitro. The immunofluorescence imaging demonstrates that CnMVs can fuse with human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), the constituents of the BBB. This activity is presumably due to the ability of the CnMVs to activate HBMEC membrane rafts and induce cell fusogenic activity. CnMVs also enhanced C. neoformans infection of the brain, found in both infected brains and cerebrospinal fluid. In infected mouse brains, CnMVs are distributed inside and around C. neoformans-induced cystic lesions. GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein)-positive astrocytes were found surrounding the cystic lesions, overlapping with the 14-3-3-GFP (14-3-3-green fluorescence protein fusion) signals. Substantial changes could be observed in areas that have a high density of CnMV staining. This is the first demonstration that C. neoformans-derived microvesicles can facilitate cryptococcal traversal across the BBB and accumulate at lesion sites of C. neoformans-infected brains. Results of this study suggested that CnMVs play an important role in the pathogenesis of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis.},

Methods Extracellular nanovesicles isolated from M. sympodialis, co-cultures of M. sympodialis and dendritic cells, and from plasma of patients with AE and healthy controls (HC) were characterised using flow cytometry, sucrose gradient centrifugation, Western blot and electron microscopy. Their ability to stimulate IL-4 and TNF-alpha responses in autologous CD14, CD34 depleted PBMC was determined using ELISPOT and ELISA, respectively. Results We show for the first time that M. sympodialis releases extracellular vesicles carrying allergen. These vesicles can induce IL-4 and TNF-{$\alpha$} responses with a significantly higher IL-4 production in patients compared to HC. Exosomes from dendritic cell and M. sympodialis co-cultures induced IL-4 and TNF-{$\alpha$} responses in autologous CD14, CD34 depleted PBMC of AE patients and HC while plasma exosomes induced TNF-{$\alpha$} but not IL-4 in undepleted PBMC. Conclusions Extracellular vesicles from M. sympodialis, dendritic cells and plasma can contribute to cytokine responses in CD14, CD34 depleted and undepleted PBMC of AE patients and HC. These novel observations have implications for understanding host-microbe interactions in the pathogenesis of AE.},

  volume = {155},
  abstract = {Recently, several pathogenic fungi were shown to produce extracellular vesicles that contain various components associated with virulence. In the human pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, these components included laccase, an enzyme that catalyses melanin synthesis. Spherical melanin granules have been observed in the cell wall of C. neoformans. Given that melanin granules have dimensions that are comparable to those of extracellular vesicles, and that metazoan organisms produce melanin in vesicular structures known as melanosomes, we investigated the role of vesicles in cryptococcal melanization. Extracellular vesicles melanized when incubated with the melanin precursor l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA). The kinetics of substrate incorporation into cells and vesicles was analysed using radiolabelled l-DOPA. The results indicated that substrate incorporation was different for cells and isolated vesicles. Acid-generated melanin ghosts stained with lipophilic dyes, implying the presence of associated lipid. A model for C. neoformans melanization is proposed that accounts for these observations and provides a mechanism for the assembly of melanin into relatively uniform spherical particles stacked in an orderly arrangement in the cell wall.},

In yeast pathogens, these vesicles have been implicated in the transport of proteins, lipids, polysaccharide and pigments to the extracellular space. Cellular pathways required for the biogenesis of yeast extracellular vesicles are largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We characterized extracellular vesicle production in wild type (WT) and mutant strains of the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transmission electron microscopy in combination with light scattering analysis, lipid extraction and proteomics. WT cells and mutants with defective expression of Sec4p, a secretory vesicle-associated Rab GTPase essential for Golgi-derived exocytosis, or Snf7p, which is involved in multivesicular body (MVB) formation, were analyzed in parallel. Bilayered vesicles with diameters at the 100\textendash{}300 nm range were found in extracellular fractions from yeast cultures. Proteomic analysis of vesicular fractions from the cells aforementioned and additional mutants with defects in conventional secretion pathways (sec1-1, fusion of Golgi-derived exocytic vesicles with the plasma membrane; bos1-1, vesicle targeting to the Golgi complex) or MVB functionality (vps23, late endosomal trafficking) revealed a complex and interrelated protein collection. Semi-quantitative analysis of protein abundance revealed that mutations in both MVB- and Golgi-derived pathways affected the composition of yeast extracellular vesicles, but none abrogated vesicle production. Lipid analysis revealed that mutants with defects in Golgi-related components of the secretory pathway had slower vesicle release kinetics, as inferred from intracellular accumulation of sterols and reduced detection of these lipids in vesicle fractions in comparison with WT cells. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that both conventional and unconventional pathways of secretion are required for biogenesis of extracellular vesicles, which demonstrate the complexity of this process in the biology of yeast cells.},

Methodology/Principal Findings Here we present a detailed lipidomic analysis of extracellular vesicles released by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis at the yeast pathogenic phase. We compared data of two representative isolates, Pb3 and Pb18, which have distinct virulence profiles and phylogenetic background. Vesicle lipids were fractionated into different classes and analyzed by either electrospray ionization- or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found two species of monohexosylceramide and 33 phospholipid species, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylglycerol. Among the phospholipid-bound fatty acids in extracellular vesicles, C181 predominated in Pb3, whereas C18:2 prevailed in Pb18. The prevalent sterol in Pb3 and Pb18 vesicles was brassicasterol, followed by ergosterol and lanosterol. Inter-isolate differences in sterol composition were observed, and also between extracellular vesicles and whole cells. Conclusions/Significance The extensive lipidomic analysis of extracellular vesicles from two P. brasiliensis isolates will help to understand the composition of these fungal components/organelles and will hopefully be useful to study their biogenesis and role in host-pathogen interactions.},

  abstract = {Candida albicans ECM33 encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell wall protein that is important for cell wall integrity. It is also critical for normal virulence in the mouse model of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. To identify potential mechanisms through which Ecm33p contributes to virulence, we investigated the interactions of C. albicans ecm33Delta mutants with endothelial cells and the FaDu oral epithelial cell line in vitro. The growth rate of blastospores of strains containing either one or no intact copies of ECM33 was 50\% slower than that of strains containing two intact copies of ECM33. However, all strains germinated at the same rate, forming similar-length hyphae on endothelial cells and oral epithelial cells. Strains containing either one or no intact copies of ECM33 had modestly reduced adherence to both types of host cells, and a markedly reduced capacity to invade and damage these cells. Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing C. albicans ECM33 did not adhere to or invade epithelial cells, suggesting that Ecm33p by itself does not act as an adhesin or invasin. Examination of ecm33Delta mutants by transmission electron microscopy revealed that the cell wall of these strains had an abnormally electron-dense outer mannoprotein layer, which may represent a compensatory response to reduced cell wall integrity. The hyphae of these mutants also had aberrant surface localization of the adhesin Als1p. Collectively, these results suggest that Ecm33p is required for normal cell wall architecture as well as normal function and expression of cell surface proteins in C. albicans.},

  abstract = {The fungal cell wall plays a crucial role in host\textendash{}pathogen interactions. Its formation is the result of the coordinated activity of several extracellular enzymes, which assemble the constituents, and remodel and hydrolyse them in the extracellular space. Candida albicans Phr1 and Phr2 proteins belong to family GH72 of the {$\beta$}-(1,3)-glucanosyltransferases and play a crucial role in cell wall assembly. PHR1 and PHR2, homologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAS1, are differently regulated by extracellular pH. PHR1 is expressed when ambient pH is 5.5 or higher, whereas PHR2 has the reverse expression pattern. Their deletion causes a pH-conditional defect in morphogenesis and virulence. In this work we explored whether PHR1 deletion affects the ability of C. albicans to adhere to and invade human epithelia. PHR1 null mutants exhibited a marked reduction in adhesion to both abiotic surfaces and epithelial cell monolayers. In addition, the mutant was unable to penetrate and invade reconstituted human epithelia. Transcription profiling of selected hyphal-specific and adhesin-encoding genes indicated that in the PHR1 null mutant, HWP1 and ECE1 transcript levels were similarly reduced in both adhesion and suspension conditions. These results, combined with microscopy analysis of the septum position, suggest that PHR1 is not required for the induction of hyphal development but plays a key role in the maintenance of hyphal growth. Thus, the {$\beta$}-(1,3)-glucan processing catalysed by Phr1p is of fundamental importance in the maintenance of the morphological state on which the adhesive and invasive properties of C. albicans greatly depend.},

Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a cell-surface protein highly expressed in embryonic tissues and in malignant carcinomas. We report that EpCAM acts as a potent inhibitor of novel protein kinase C (nPKC) in both embryos and cancer cells. We observed dramatic effects of loss of EpCAM on~amphibian embryonic tissues, which include sequentially strong overstimulation of PKC activity and of the Erk pathway, leading to exacerbated myosin contractility, loss of cadherin-mediated adhesion, tissue dissociation, and, ultimately, cell death. We show that PKC inhibition is caused by a short segment of the EpCAM cytoplasmic tail. This motif resembles the pseudosubstrate inhibitory domains of PKCs and binds nPKCs with high affinity. A bioinformatics search reveals the existence of similar motifs in other plasma membrane proteins, most of which are cell-cell adhesion molecules. Thus, direct inhibition of PKC by EpCAM represents a general mode of regulation of signal transduction by cell-surface proteins.},

The acquisition of iron by biological systems is regulated to circumvent toxicity of iron overload, as well as the growth deficits imposed by iron deficiency. In addition, hosts, such as humans, need to limit the availability of iron to pathogens. However, opportunistic pathogens such as Candida albicans are able to adapt to extremes of iron availability, such as the iron replete environment of the gastrointestinal tract and iron deficiency during systemic infection. Candida albicans has developed a complex and effective regulatory circuit for iron acquisition and storage to circumvent iron limitation within the human host. As C. albicans can form complex interactions with both commensal and pathogenic co-inhabitants, it can be speculated that iron may play an important role in these interactions. In this review, we highlight the regulation of iron homeostasis within the host as well as C. albicans. In addition, the review argues for the need for further research into the role of iron in polymicrobial interactions. Lastly, the role of iron in treatment of C. albicans infection is discussed.},

In the present study, we characterized a FAA homologue (CaFAA4) from the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans. Most organisms can not only synthesize long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs (LCFA-CoAs) endogenously using a fatty acid synthase (Fas) activity but also can uptake long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) from the extracellular environment and convert them into LCFA-CoAs via a vectorial acylation system. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses two LCFA-CoA synthetases, ScFaa1p and ScFaa4p. The disruption of ScFAA1 and ScFAA4 leads to synthetic lethality in the presence of a fatty acid synthesis inhibitor\textemdash{}cerulenin. The homologue\textemdash{}CaFAA4\textemdash{}rescued the lethality of an S. cerevisiae Scfaa1\textendash{}Scfaa4 double mutant in the presence of cerulenin. On the other hand, a C. albicans faa4 mutant was unable to grow in the presence of cerulenin even if LCFAs were provided exogenously. Moreover, a biofilm analysis showed that the metabolic activity of the Cafaa4 mutant was approximately 40\% lower than that of the wild-type parent, even though there was no significant difference in cell number or cell morphology between these strains. Notably, the Cafaa4 mutant showed increased susceptibility to micafungin during biofilm formation, a phenotype that presumably can be attributed to the impaired metabolism of the mutant strain. These results indicated that CaFaa4p is the unique C. albicans Faa protein responsible for activating LCFAs and is involved in the metabolism of biofilms.},

In the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans, the Rho G proteins Cdc42 and Rac1 are required for the switch from budding to filamentous growth in response to different stimuli. We show that Dck1, a protein with homology to the Ced-5, Dock180, myoblast city family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, is necessary for filamentous growth in solid media, similar to Rac1. Our results indicate that Dck1 and Rac1 do not function in the same pathway as the transcription factor Czf1, which is also required for embedded filamentous growth. The conserved catalytic region of Dck1 is required for such filamentous growth, and in vitro this region directly binds a Rac1 mutant, which mimics the nucleotide-free state. In vivo overexpression of a constitutively active Rac1 mutant, but not wild-type Rac1, in a dck1 deletion mutant restores filamentous growth. These results indicate that the Dock180 guanine nucleotide exchange factor homologue, Dck1 activates Rac1 during invasive filamentous growth.

One of its recently identified functions is the regulation of beta-1,3-glucan synthase, which synthesizes the main component of the fungal cell wall (J. Drgonova et al., Science 272:277-279, 1996; T. Mazur and W. Baginsky, J. Biol. Chem. 271:14604-14609, 1996; and H. Qadota et al., Science 272:279-281, 1996). From the opportunistic pathogenic fungus Candida albicans, we cloned the RHO1 gene by the PCR and cross-hybridization methods. Sequence analysis revealed that the Candida RHO1 gene has a 597-nucleotide region which encodes a putative 22.0-kDa peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts that Candida albicans Rho1p is 82.9\% identical to Saccharomyces Rho1p and contains all the domains conserved among Rho-type GTPases from other organisms. The Candida albicans RHO1 gene could rescue a S. cerevisiae strain containing a rho1 deletion. Furthermore, recombinant Candida albicans Rho1p could reactivate the beta-1,3-glucan synthesis activities of both C. albicans and S. cerevisiae membranes in which endogenous Rho1p had been depleted by Tergitol NP-40-NaCl treatment. Candida albicans Rho1p was copurified with the beta-1,3-glucan synthase putative catalytic subunit, Candida albicans Gsc1p, by product entrapment. Candida albicans Rho1p was shown to interact directly with Candida albicans Gsc1p in a ligand overlay assay and a cross-linking study. These results indicate that Candida albicans Rho1p acts in the same manner as Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rho1p to regulate beta-1,3-glucan synthesis.},

  abstract = {Polarized cells reorient their direction of growth in response to environmental cues. In the fungus Candida albicans, the Rho-family small GTPase, Cdc42, is essential for polarized hyphal growth and Ca2+ influx is required for the tropic responses of hyphae to environmental cues, but the regulatory link between these systems is unclear. In this study, the interaction between Ca2+ influx and Cdc42 polarity-complex dynamics was investigated using hyphal galvanotropic and thigmotropic responses as reporter systems. During polarity establishment in an applied electric field, cathodal emergence of hyphae was lost when either of the two Cdc42 apical recycling pathways was disrupted by deletion of Rdi1, a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, or Bnr1, a formin, but was completely restored by extracellular Ca2+. Loss of the Cdc42 GTPase activating proteins, Rga2 and Bem3, also abolished cathodal polarization, but this was not rescued by Ca2+. Expression of GTP-locked Cdc42 reversed the polarity of hypha emergence from cathodal to anodal, an effect augmented by Ca2+. The cathodal directional cue therefore requires Cdc42 GTP hydrolysis. Ca2+ influx amplifies Cdc42-mediated directional growth signals, in part by augmenting Cdc42 apical trafficking. The Ca2+-binding EF-hand motif in Cdc24, the Cdc42 activator, was essential for growth in yeast cells but not in established hyphae. The Cdc24 EF-hand motif is therefore essential for polarity establishment but not for polarity maintenance.},

Analyses of different chimeras revealed that nuclear accumulation of C. albicans Rac1 requires the NLS-motifs at its carboxyl-terminus, which are blocked by prenylation of the adjacent cysteine residue. Furthermore, we show that C. albicans Rac1 dynamics, both at the plasma membrane and in the nucleus, are dependent on its activation state and in particular that the inactive form accumulates faster in the nucleus. Heterologous expression of human Rac1 in C. albicans also results in nuclear accumulation, yet accumulation is more rapid than that of C. albicans Rac1. Taken together our results indicate that Rac1 nuclear accumulation is an inherent property of this G-protein and suggest that the requirements for its nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling are conserved from fungi to humans.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Annexins are multifunctional proteins that bind to phospholipid membranes in a calcium-dependent manner. Annexins play a myriad of critical and well-characterized roles in mammals, ranging from membrane repair to vesicular secretion. The role of annexins in the kingdoms of bacteria, protozoa and fungi have been largely overlooked. The fact that there is no known homologue of annexins in the model organism may contribute to this gap in knowledge. However, annexins are found in most medically important fungal pathogens, with the notable exception of Candida albicans. In this study we evaluated the function of the one annexin gene in Cryptococcus neoformans, a causative agent of cryptococcosis. This gene CNAG\_02415, is annotated in the C. neoformans genome as a target of calcineurin through its transcription factor Crz1, and we propose to update its name to cryptococcal annexin, AnnexinC1. C. neoformans strains deleted for AnnexinC1 revealed no difference in survival after exposure to various chemical stressor relative the wild type, as well as no major alteration in virulence or mating. The only alteration observed in strains deleted for AnnexinC1 was a small increase in the titan cells formation in vitro. The preservation of annexins in many different fungal species suggests an important function, and therefore the lack of a strong phenotype for annexin-deficient C. neoformans is suggestive of either redundant genes that can compensate for the absence of AnnexinC1 function or novel functions not revealed by standard assays of cell function and pathogenicity.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, some of these techniques can be very complicated and challenging, resulting in various drawbacks. Exosomes can be used as potential carriers for therapeutics.

This is in large part due to the fact that MVs contain a variety of cargo that is not typically thought to be released from cells including cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinases, cytosolic and nuclear signaling proteins and RNA transcripts. MVs, by sharing their contents with other cells, can greatly impact cancer progression by increasing primary tumor growth,1\textendash{}3 as well as by promoting the development of the pre-metastatic niche.4 We have recently shown that the small GTPase RhoA is critical for MV biogenesis in human cancer cells. Moreover, we have now obtained evidence that implicates the highly related small GTPases, Rac and Cdc42, in regulating the loading of specific cargo into MVs, as well as in the shedding of MVs from cancer cells. Thus, linking the Rho family of small GTPases to MV biogenesis has begun to shed some light on a new and unexpected way that these signaling proteins contribute to human cancer progression.},

As extracellular entities they have the capacity to interact with neighbouring cells and distant tissues and affect physiological processes as well as being implicated in numerous diseases including tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration. They are also under intense investigation as delivery vectors for biotherapeutics. The ways in which EVs interact with recipient cells to influence cell physiology and deliver a macromolecular payload are at the early stages of exploration. A significant challenge within these studies is the ability to label EVs directly or indirectly with fluorescent probes to allow visualization without compromising functionality. Here, we present a thiol-based fluorescence labelling method allowing comprehensive analysis of the cellular uptake of prostate cancer derived EVs in live cells using confocal microscopy. Labelling of the EVs in this way did not influence their size and had no effect on their ability to induce differentiation of lung fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. For endocytosis analyses, depletion of key endocytic proteins and the use of chemical inhibitors (Dynasore, EIPA, Rottlerin and IPA-3) indicated that fluid-phase endocytosis and/or macropinocytosis was involved in EV internalisation. Over a period of six hours EVs were observed to increasingly co-localise with lysosomes, indicating a possible termination point following internalisation. Overall this method provides new opportunities for analysing the cellular dynamics of EVs as biological entities affecting cell and whole body physiology as well as investigating their potential as drug delivery vectors.},

Plants can use small RNAs (sRNAs) to interfere with virulence factor gene expression in pathogens. Cai et al. show that the small mustard plant Arabidopsis shuttles defensive sRNAs into the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea via extracellular vesicles (see the Perspective by Thomma and Cook). The vesicles are associated with tetraspanin proteins, which can interact and form membrane microdomains. Several dozen different sRNAs targeting the pathogenic process were transported from Arabidopsis to B. cinerea in a selective manner.
Science, this issue p. 1126; see also p. 1070
Some pathogens and pests deliver small RNAs (sRNAs) into host cells to suppress host immunity. Conversely, hosts also transfer sRNAs into pathogens and pests to inhibit their virulence. Although sRNA trafficking has been observed in a wide variety of interactions, how sRNAs are transferred, especially from hosts to pathogens and pests, is still unknown. Here, we show that host Arabidopsis cells secrete exosome-like extracellular vesicles to deliver sRNAs into fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. These sRNA-containing vesicles accumulate at the infection sites and are taken up by the fungal cells. Transferred host sRNAs induce silencing of fungal genes critical for pathogenicity. Thus, Arabidopsis has adapted exosome-mediated cross-kingdom RNA interference as part of its immune responses during the evolutionary arms race with the pathogen.
Exosomal vesicles shuttle defensive small RNAs from the host plant to a pathogenic fungus.

  abstract = {Inter-cellular and inter-kingdom signaling systems of various levels of complexity regulate pathogenic and mutualistic interactions between bacteria, parasites, and fungi and animal and plant hosts. Inter-kingdom interactions between mutualistic bacteria such as rhizobia and legumes during nodulation and between fungi and plants during mycorrhizal associations, are characterized by the extensive exchange of molecular signals, which allow nitrogen and phosphate assimilation, respectively. A novel aspect of this signaling exchange is the existence of specific structures, the exosomes, that carry important molecules that shape the plant\textendash{}pathogen interactions. Exosomes contain a wide array of molecules, such as lipids, proteins, messenger RNA, and microRNAs, that play important roles in cell-to-cell communication in animal and plant cells by affecting gene expression and other physiological activity in distant cells within the same organism (e.g., during cancer metastases and neuron injuries). In plant cells, it has been recently reported that exosomes go beyond organism boundaries and inhibit a pathogenic interaction in plants. Plant produce and send exosomes loaded with specific small miRNA which inhibit the pathogen infection, but the pathogen can also produce exosomes carrying pro-pathogenic proteins and microRNAs. Therefore, exosomes are the important bridge regulating the signal exchange. Exosomes are small membrane-bound vesicles derived from multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which carries selected cargos from the cytoplasm (protein, lipids, and microRNAs) and under certain circumstances, they fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing the small vesicles as cargo-carrying exosomes into the extracellular space during intercellular and inter-kingdom communication. Animal and plant proteomic studies have demonstrated that tetraspanin proteins are an integral part of exosome membranes, positioning tetraspanins as essential components for endosome organization, with key roles in membrane fusion, cell trafficking, and membrane recognition. We discuss the similarities and differences between animal tetraspanins and plant tetraspanins formed during plant\textendash{}microbe interactions and their potential role in mutualistic communication.},

Proteome analyses indicated that afEVs are enriched in antimicrobial proteins. The cargo and release kinetics of afEVs are modulated by the fungal strain confronted. Tracking of produced afEVs indicated that they associated with fungal cells and even entered fungal hyphae, resulting in alterations in the morphology of the fungal cell wall, and imparted antifungal effects dose-dependently. Two identified human proteins of afEVs, cathepsin G and azurocidin, were heterologously expressed in fungal hyphae, which led to reduced fungal growth. In conclusion, the production of afEVs by PMNs offers an intriguing, previously overlooked mechanism of antifungal defense against \emph{A. fumigatus}.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Screening for infectivity in a mouse model and for morphological switching and cell proliferation in vitro, we identified 115 infectivity-attenuated mutants, of which nearly half demonstrated normal morphological switching and proliferation.

In the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans, Tup1 regulates cellular morphogenesis, phenotypic switching, and metabolism, but the role of Ssn6 remains unclear. We show that there are clear differences in the morphological and invasive phenotypes of C. albicans ssn6 and tup1 mutants. Unlike Tup1, Ssn6 depletion promoted morphological events reminiscent of phenotypic switching rather than filamentous growth. Transcript profiling revealed minimal overlap between the Ssn6 and Tup1 regulons. Hypha-specific genes, which are repressed by Tup1 and Nrg1, were not derepressed in ssn6 cells under the conditions studied. In contrast, the phase specific gene WH11 was derepressed in ssn6 cells, but not in tup1 or nrg1 cells. Hence Ssn6 and Tup1 play distinct roles in C. albicans. Nevertheless, both Ssn6 and Tup1 were required for the Nrg1-mediated repression of an artificial NRE promoter, and lexA-Nrg1 mediated repression in the C. albicans one-hybrid system. These observations are explained in models that are generally consistent with the Tup1-Ssn6 paradigm in budding yeast.},

  abstract = {Candida albicans is the most common human fungal pathogen, causing infections that can be lethal in immunocompromised patients. Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as a model for C. albicans, it lacks C. albicans' diverse morphogenic forms and is primarily non-pathogenic. Comprehensive genetic analyses that have been instrumental for determining gene function in S. cerevisiae are hampered in C. albicans, due in part to limited resources to systematically assay phenotypes of loss-of-function alleles. Here, we constructed and screened a library of 3633 tagged heterozygous transposon disruption mutants, using them in a competitive growth assay to examine nutrient- and drug-dependent haploinsufficiency. We identified 269 genes that were haploinsufficient in four growth conditions, the majority of which were condition-specific. These screens identified two new genes necessary for filamentous growth as well as ten genes that function in essential processes. We also screened 57 chemically diverse compounds that more potently inhibited growth of C. albicans versus S. cerevisiae. For four of these compounds, we examined the genetic basis of this differential inhibition. Notably, Sec7p was identified as the target of brefeldin A in C. albicans screens, while S. cerevisiae screens with this compound failed to identify this target. We also uncovered a new C. albicans-specific target, Tfp1p, for the synthetic compound 0136-0228. These results highlight the value of haploinsufficiency screens directly in this pathogen for gene annotation and drug target identification.},

  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis are pathogenic fungi that are highly related but differ in virulence and in some phenotypic traits. During in vitro growth on certain nutrient-poor media, C. albicans and C. dubliniensis are the only yeast species which are able to produce chlamydospores, large thick-walled cells of unknown function. Interestingly, only C. dubliniensis forms pseudohyphae with abundant chlamydospores when grown on Staib medium, while C. albicans grows exclusively as a budding yeast. In order to further our understanding of chlamydospore development and assembly, we compared the global transcriptional profile of both species during growth in liquid Staib medium by RNA sequencing. We also included a C. albicans mutant in our study which lacks the morphogenetic transcriptional repressor Nrg1. This strain, which is characterized by its constitutive pseudohyphal growth, specifically produces masses of chlamydospores in Staib medium, similar to C. dubliniensis. This comparative approach identified a set of putatively chlamydospore-related genes. Two of the homologous C. albicans and C. dubliniensis genes (CSP1 and CSP2) which were most strongly upregulated during chlamydospore development were analysed in more detail. By use of the green fluorescent protein as a reporter, the encoded putative cell wall related proteins were found to exclusively localize to C. albicans and C. dubliniensis chlamydospores. Our findings uncover the first chlamydospore specific markers in Candida species and provide novel insights in the complex morphogenetic development of these important fungal pathogens.},

EVs shuttle biologically active cargo including protein, RNA, and DNA between cells. When shed by cancer cells, they function as potent intercellular messangers with important functional consequences. Cells produce a diverse spectrum of EVs, spanning from small vesicles of 40\textendash{}150 nm in diameter, to large vesicles up to 10 {$\mu$}m in diameter. While this diversity was initially considered to be purely based on size, it is becoming evident that different classes of EVs, and different populations within one EV class may harbor distinct molecular cargo and play specific functions. Furthermore, there are considerable cell type-dependent differences in the cargo and function of shed EVs. This review focuses on the most recent proteomic studies that have attempted to capture the EV heterogeneity by directly comparing the protein composition of different EV classes and EV populations derived from the same cell source. Recent studies comparing protein composition of the same EV class(es) derived from different cell types are also summarized. Emerging approaches to study EV heterogeneity and their important implications for future studies are also discussed.},

  issn = {0009-9147, 1530-8561},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) in biofluids are potential biomarkers of disease. To explore the clinical relevance of EVs, a specific generic EV marker would be useful, one that does not require antibodies and binds to all EVs. Here we evaluated 5 commonly used generic markers for flow cytometry.
METHODS: Flow cytometry (A60-Micro, Apogee) was used to evaluate the ability of the generic EV markers calcein acetoxymethyl ester, calcein acetoxymethyl ester violet, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE), 4-(2-[6-(dioctylamino)-2-naphthalenyl]ethenyl)-1-(3-sulfopropyl)pyridinium (di-8-ANEPPS), and lactadherin to stain EVs from MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma cell line-conditioned culture medium [epithelial cell adhesion molecule positive (EpCAM+)] or platelet EVs from human plasma [integrin {$\beta$}3 positive (CD61+)]. Side scatter triggering was applied as a reference, and the influence of non-EV components (proteins and lipoproteins) was evaluated.
RESULTS: Di-8-ANEPPS, lactadherin, and side scatter detected 100\% of EpCAM+ MCF7 EVs. Lactadherin and side scatter detected 33\% and 61\% of CD61+ EVs, respectively. Di-8-ANEPPS detected platelet EVs only if soluble protein was first removed. Because all generic markers stained proteins, at best 33\% of platelet EVs in plasma were detected. The calcein markers and CFSE were either insensitive to EVs in both samples or associated with swarm detection.
CONCLUSIONS: None of the generic markers detected all and only EVs in plasma. Side scatter triggering detected the highest concentration of plasma EVs on our A60-Micro, followed by lactadherin. The choice between scatter or lactadherin primarily depends on the analytical sensitivity of the flow cytometer used.},

Current techniques to study exosome physiology are based on isolation procedures after secretion, precluding direct and dynamic insight into the mechanics of exosome biogenesis and the regulation of their release. In this study, we propose real-time visualization of MVB\textendash{}PM fusion to overcome these limitations. We designed tetraspanin-based pH-sensitive optical reporters that detect MVB\textendash{}PM fusion using live total internal reflection fluorescence and dynamic correlative light\textendash{}electron microscopy. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that MVB\textendash{}PM fusion frequency is reduced by depleting the target membrane SNAREs SNAP23 and syntaxin-4 but also can be induced in single cells by stimulation of the histamine H1 receptor (H1HR). Interestingly, activation of H1R1 in HeLa cells increases Ser110 phosphorylation of SNAP23, promoting MVB\textendash{}PM fusion and the release of CD63-enriched exosomes. Using this single-cell resolution approach, we highlight the modulatory dynamics of MVB exocytosis that will help to increase our understanding of exosome physiology and identify druggable targets in exosome-associated pathologies.},

  abstract = {Cryptococcus gattii is an emerging intracellular pathogen and the cause of the largest primary outbreak of a life-threatening fungal disease in a healthy population. Outbreak strains share a unique mitochondrial gene expression profile and an increased ability to tubularize their mitochondria within host macrophages. However, the underlying mechanism that causes this lineage of C. gattii to be virulent in immunocompetent individuals remains unexplained. Here we show that a subpopulation of intracellular C. gattii adopts a tubular mitochondrial morphology in response to host reactive oxygen species. These fungal cells then facilitate the rapid growth of neighbouring C. gattii cells with non-tubular mitochondria, allowing for effective establishment of the pathogen within a macrophage intracellular niche. Thus, host reactive oxygen species, an essential component of the innate immune response, act as major signalling molecules to trigger a `division of labour' in the intracellular fungal population, leading to increased pathogenesis within this outbreak lineage.},

These trough-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane have largely been studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which their associated proteins, including two BAR domain proteins, have been identified, and homologues have been found throughout the fungal radiation. Using quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy to generate high-resolution replicas of membrane fracture faces without the use of chemical fixation, we report that eisosomes are also present in a subset of red and green microalgae as well as in the cysts of the ciliate Euplotes. Eisosome assembly is closely correlated with both the presence and the nature of cell walls. Microalgal eisosomes vary extensively in topology and internal organization. Unlike fungi, their convex fracture faces can carry lineage-specific arrays of intramembranous particles, and their concave fracture faces usually display fine striations, also seen in fungi, that are pitched at lineage-specific angles and, in some cases, adopt a broad-banded patterning. The conserved genes that encode fungal eisosome-associated proteins are not found in sequenced algal genomes, but we identified genes encoding two algal lineage-specific families of predicted BAR domain proteins, called Green-BAR and Red-BAR, that are candidate eisosome organizers. We propose a model for eisosome formation wherein (i) positively charged recognition patches first establish contact with target membrane regions and (ii) a (partial) unwinding of the coiled-coil conformation of the BAR domains then allows interactions between the hydrophobic faces of their amphipathic helices and the lipid phase of the inner membrane leaflet, generating the striated patterns.},

  abstract = {In an effort to bring novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers or even potential targets for vaccine design for systemic candidiasis (SC) into the open, a systematic proteomic approach coupled with bioinformatic analysis was used to decode the serological response to Candida wall immunome in SC patients. Serum levels of IgG antibodies against Candida wall-associated proteins (proteins secreted from protoplasts in active wall regeneration, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and identified by mass spectrometry) were measured in 45 SC patients, 57 non-SC patients, and 61 healthy subjects by Western blotting. Two-way hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis of their serum anti-Candida wall antibody expression patterns discriminated SC patients from controls and highlighted the heterogeneity of their expression profiles. Multivariate logistic regression models demonstrated that high levels of antibodies against glucan 1,3-{$\beta$}-glucosidase (Bgl2p) and the anti-wall phosphoglycerate kinase antibody seropositivity were the only independent predictors of SC. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed no difference between their combined evaluation and measurement of anti-Bgl2p antibodies alone. In a logistic regression model adjusted for known prognostic factors for mortality, SC patients with high anti-Bgl2p antibody levels or a positive anti-wall enolase antibody status, which correlated with each other, had a reduced 2-month risk of death. After controlling for each other, only the seropositivity for anti-wall enolase antibodies was an independent predictor of a lower risk of fatality, supporting that these mediated the protective effect. No association between serum anti-cytoplasmic enolase antibody levels and outcomes was established, suggesting a specific mechanism of enolase processing during wall biogenesis. We conclude that serum anti-Bgl2p antibodies are a novel accurate diagnostic biomarker for SC and that, at high levels, they may provide protection by modulating the anti-wall enolase antibody response. Furthermore serum anti-wall enolase antibodies are a new prognostic indicator for SC and confer protection against it. Bgl2p and wall-associated enolase could be valuable candidates for future vaccine development.},

To explore the use of exosomes in the clinic, it is essential that the basic molecular mechanisms behind the transport and function of these vesicles are better understood.

  volume = {10},
  issn = {1932-6157, 1941-7330},
  abstract = {One of the most common analysis tasks in genomic research is to identify genes that are differentially expressed (DE) between experimental conditions. Empirical Bayes (EB) statistical tests using moderated genewise variances have been very effective for this purpose, especially when the number of biological replicate samples is small. The EB procedures can, however, be heavily influenced by a small number of genes with very large or very small variances. This article improves the differential expression tests by robustifying the hyperparameter estimation procedure. The robust procedure has the effect of decreasing the informativeness of the prior distribution for outlier genes while increasing its informativeness for other genes. This effect has the double benefit of reducing the chance that hypervariable genes will be spuriously identified as DE while increasing statistical power for the main body of genes. The robust EB algorithm is fast and numerically stable. The procedure allows exact small-sample null distributions for the test statistics and reduces exactly to the original EB procedure when no outlier genes are present. Simulations show that the robustified tests have similar performance to the original tests in the absence of outlier genes but have greater power and robustness when outliers are present. The article includes case studies for which the robust method correctly identifies and downweights genes associated with hidden covariates and detects more genes likely to be scientifically relevant to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in the limma software package freely available from the Bioconductor repository.},

Breast cancer cells transferred their own exosomes to other cancer cells and normal lung tissue cells in culture. In orthotopic nude-mouse models, breast cancer cells secreted exosomes into the tumor microenvironment. Tumor-derived exosomes were incorporated into tumor-associated cells as well as circulating in the blood of mice with breast cancer metastases. These results suggest that tumor-derived exosomes may contribute to forming a niche to promote tumor growth and metastasis.

  abstract = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have become an attractive field among the scientific community. Yet, a major challenge is to define a consensus method for EVs isolation. Ultracentrifugation has been the most widely used methodology but rapid methods, including Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) and/or precipitating agents such as Polyethylene glycol (PEG) or PRotein Organic Solvent PRecipitation (PROSPR) have emerged. To evaluate the impact of these different methods on the resulting EV preparations, plasma EVs were isolated using SEC, PEG and PROSPR, and their total protein content, NTA and Cryo-electron microscopy profiles, and EV-markers were compared. Also, their effect on recipient cells was tested. Low protein content and Cryo-EM analysis showed that SEC removed most of the overabundant soluble plasma proteins, which were not removed using PEG and partially by PROSPR. Moreover, only SEC allowed the detection of the EV-markers CD9, CD63 and CD81, LGALS3BP and CD5L, suggesting a putative interference of the precipitating agents in the structure/composition of the EVs. Furthermore, PEG and PROSPR-based EV isolation resulted in reduced cell viability in vitro. These results stress that appropriate EV-isolation method should be considered depending on the forthcoming application of the purified EVs.},

EVs were isolated from in vitro cultured cells-conditioned medium and biological fluids by size exclusion chromatography and coupled to latex beads to allow their detection by standard flow cytometers. Our analyses demonstrate a linear correlation between EV concentration and Mean Fluorescence Intensity values in samples cleared of protein contaminants. Comparison with one of the most widespread method such as NTA, suggests a similar linear range and reliable accuracy to detect saturation. However, although detection of the different biomarkers is feasible when tested on ultracentrifugation-enriched samples, protein contamination impairs quantitation of this type of samples by bead-based flow cytometry. Thus, we provide evidence that bead-assisted flow cytometry method is an accurate and reliable method for the semiquantitative bulk analysis of EVs, which could be easily implemented in most laboratories.},

  abstract = {Extracellular polysaccharides are key constituents of the biofilm matrix of many microorganisms. One critical carbohydrate component of Candida albicans biofilms, {$\beta$}-1,3 glucan, has been linked to biofilm protection from antifungal agents. In this study, we identify three glucan modification enzymes that function to deliver glucan from the cell to the extracellular matrix. These enzymes include two predicted glucan transferases and an exo-glucanase, encoded by BGL2, PHR1, and XOG1, respectively. We show that the enzymes are crucial for both delivery of {$\beta$}-1,3 glucan to the biofilm matrix and for accumulation of mature matrix biomass. The enzymes do not appear to impact cell wall glucan content of biofilm cells, nor are they necessary for filamentation or biofilm formation. We demonstrate that mutants lacking these genes exhibit enhanced susceptibility to the commonly used antifungal, fluconazole, during biofilm growth only. Transcriptional analysis and biofilm phenotypes of strains with multiple mutations suggest that these enzymes act in a complementary fashion to distribute matrix downstream of the primary {$\beta$}-1,3 glucan synthase encoded by FKS1. Furthermore, our observations suggest that this matrix delivery pathway works independently from the C. albicans ZAP1 matrix formation regulatory pathway. These glucan modification enzymes appear to play a biofilm-specific role in mediating the delivery and organization of mature biofilm matrix. We propose that the discovery of inhibitors for these enzymes would provide promising anti-biofilm therapeutics.},

In fungal species, extracellular vesicles (EVs) participate in the export of polysaccharides, proteins and RNA. In the present work, we investigated if EV-mediated RNA export is functionally connected with GRASP in C. neoformans using a grasp\&Delta; mutant. Since GRASP-mediated unconventional secretion involves autophagosome formation in yeast, we included the atg7\&Delta; mutant with defective autophagic mechanisms in our analysis. All fungal strains exported EVs but deletion of GRASP or ATG7 profoundly affected vesicular dimensions. The mRNA content of the grasp\&Delta; EVs differed substantially from that of the other two strains. The transcripts associated to the endoplasmic reticulum were highly abundant transcripts in grasp\&Delta; EVs. Among non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), tRNA fragments were the most abundant in both mutant EVs but grasp\&Delta; EVs alone concentrated 22 exclusive sequences. In general, our results showed that the EV RNA content from atg7\&Delta; and WT were more related than the RNA content of grasp\&Delta;, suggesting that GRASP, but not the autophagy regulator Atg7, is involved in the EV export of RNA. This is a previously unknown function for a key regulator of unconventional secretion in eukaryotic cells.},

Total EV carbohydrates were ethanol-precipitated from preparations depleted of lipids and proteins, then analyzed by chemical degradation, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance and size-exclusion chromatography. EV glycosyl residues of Glc, Man, and Gal comprised most probably two major components: a high molecular mass 4,6-{$\alpha$}-glucan and a galactofuranosylmannan, possibly an oligomer, bearing a 2-{$\alpha$}-Manp main chain linked to {$\beta$}-Galf (1,3) and {$\alpha$}-Manp (1,6) end units. The results also suggested the presence of small amounts of a (1{$\rightarrow$}6)-Manp polymer, (1{$\rightarrow$}3)-glucan and (1{$\rightarrow$}6)-glucan. Glycan microarrays allowed identification of EV surface lectin(s), while plant lectin microarray profiling revealed terminal Man and GlcNAc residues exposed at the EVs surface. Mammalian lectin microarray profiling showed that DC-SIGN receptors recognized surface carbohydrate in Paracoccidioides EVs. Our results suggest that oligosaccharides, cytoplasmic storage, and cell wall polysaccharides can be exported in fungal EVs, which also expose surface PAMPs and lectins. The role of these newly identified components in the interaction with the host remains to be unraveled.},

Addition of EV to macrophages also promoted transcription of the M1-polarization marker iNOs and diminish that of the M2 markers Arginase-1, Ym-1, and FIZZ-1. Furthermore, the augmented expression of M2-polarization markers, stimulated by IL-4 plus IL-10, was reverted toward an M1 phenotype in response to secondary stimulation with EVs from P. brasiliensis.

  abstract = {Extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, are small membranous vesicles released from many biotypes, contributing to the disease progression and spreading. These extracellular vesicles provide an important mode of cell-to-cell communication by delivering proteins, lipids and RNA to target cells. Exosomes are found associated with neurodegenerative diseases, which are characterised by progressive degeneration of neurons and often associated with misfolded protein. The common diseases include Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's diseases (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and the prion diseases. Of all neurodegenerative diseases, prion diseases are classified as the distinctive group owing to its transmissible and infectious nature of misfolded prion protein. The infectious prion particles have been demonstrated to be present in exosomes to spread prion infectivity within cells. Similarly, misfolded proteins involved in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyloid-{$\beta$} and tau in AD, {$\alpha$}-synuclein in PD, and superoxide dismutase 1 in ALS have been demonstrated to exploit exosomes for induced spreading of misfolded proteins in a prion-like mechanism. Furthermore, RNA molecules can be taken up by the recipient cells as cargo in exosomes. These RNAs can module the expression of the target genes by repressing or inhibiting protein translation. Here we review the role of exosomes in prion diseases and other common neurodegenerative diseases, and discuss the potential of these vesicles for disease pathogenesis.},

  shorttitle = {The Global Problem of Antifungal Resistance},
  abstract = {Summary
All serious fungal infections need appropriate antifungal therapy for successful patient outcome. Only a few classes of antifungal drugs are available, so the emergence of resistance to single drug classes and now multidrug resistance greatly hampers patient management. Azole resistance among Candida and Aspergillus species is one of the greatest challenges to clinical success, followed by echinocandin and multidrug resistance among some Candida species, especially Candida glabrata. The spread of agriculturally derived azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus and emerging threats such as multidrug resistant Candida auris are also alarming. The molecular mechanisms that cause drug resistance are naturally occurring in less susceptible species and are acquired in strains of susceptible organisms. Drug resistance mechanisms include altered drug-target interactions, reduced cellular drug concentrations mediated by drug efflux transporters, and permeability barriers associated with biofilms. Although C auris is inherently multidrug resistant, other strains typically develop resistance through stepwise selection of multiple drug-resistance mechanisms. Cellular stress induced by drug treatment promotes adaptation, which contributes to breakthrough resistance. Drug exposure also drives the emergence of resistance. An effective antifungal stewardship programme is essential to control drug resistance, and should incorporate rapid fungal diagnostics, therapeutic drug monitoring, and clinical intervention teams. The development of better diagnostic tools and strategies that allow targeted use of antifungals is essential to preserve drug effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Fungal infections due to Candida and Aspergillus species cause extensive morbidity and mortality, especially among immunosuppressed patients, and antifungal therapy is critical to patient management. Yet only a few drug classes are available to treat invasive fungal diseases, and this problem is compounded by the emergence of antifungal resistance. Echinocandin drugs are the preferred choice to treat candidiasis. They are the first cell wall\textendash{}active agents and target the fungal-specific enzyme glucan synthase, which catalyzes the biosynthesis of {$\beta$}-1,3-glucan, a key cell wall polymer. Therapeutic failures occur rarely among common Candida species, with the exception of Candida glabrata, which is frequently multidrug resistant. Echinocandin resistance in susceptible species is always acquired during therapy. The mechanism of resistance involves amino acid changes in hot-spot regions of Fks subunits of glucan synthase, which decrease the sensitivity of the enzyme to drug. Cellular stress response pathways lead to drug adaptation, which promotes the formation of resistant fks strains. Clinical factors promoting echinocandin resistance include empiric therapy, prophylaxis, gastrointestinal reservoirs, and intra-abdominal infections. A better understanding of the echinocandin-resistance mechanism, along with cellular and clinical factors promoting resistance, will facilitate more effective strategies to overcome and prevent echinocandin resistance.},

  abstract = {Within the limited antifungal armamentarium, the azole antifungals are the most frequent class used to treat Candida infections. Azole antifungals such as fluconazole are often preferred treatment for many Candida infections as they are inexpensive, exhibit limited toxicity, and are available for oral administration. There is, however, extensive documentation of intrinsic and developed resistance to azole antifungals among several Candida species. As the frequency of azole resistant Candida isolates in the clinical setting increases, it is essential to elucidate the mechanisms of such resistance in order to both preserve and improve upon the azole class of antifungals for the treatment of Candida infections. This review examines azole resistance in infections caused by C. albicans as well as the emerging non-albicans Candida species C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, and C. glabrata and, in particular, describes the current understanding of molecular basis of azole resistance in these fungal species.},

The high prevalence of superficial mycotic infections shows that 20\textendash{}25\% of the world's population has skin mycoses, making these one of the most frequent forms of infection. Pathogens responsible for skin mycoses are primarily anthropophilic and zoophilic dermatophytes from the genera Trichophyton (T.), Microsporum (M.) and Epidermophyton (E.). There appears to be considerable inter- and intra-continental variability in the global incidence of these fungal infections. Trichophyton rubrum, T. interdigitale (mentagrophytes var. interdigitale), M. canis, M. audouinii, T. tonsurans and T. verrucosum are the most common, but the attack rates and incidence of specific mycoses can vary widely. Local socio-economic conditions and cultural practices can also influence the prevalence of a particular infection in a given area. For example, tinea pedis (athlete's foot) is more prevalent in developed countries than in emerging economies and is likely to be caused by the anthropophilic germ T. rubrum. In poorer countries, scalp infections (tinea capitis) caused by T. soudanense or M. audouinii are more prevalent. This review summarises current epidemiological trends for fungal infections and focuses on dermatomycosis of glabrous skin on different continents.},

Many of these genes are homologous to nonessential Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, and some have no S. cerevisiae homolog. These findings may expand the range of antifungal drug targets. We have also identified new genes required for pH-dependent filamentation, a trait previously associated with virulence. One newly identified gene, MDS3, is required for expression in alkaline media of two filamentation-associated genes, HWP1 and ECE1, but is not required for expression of other pH-response genes. In S. cerevisiae, the two MDS3 homologs are required for growth in alkaline media, thus arguing that Mds3p function in adaptation to external pH changes is conserved. Epistasis tests show that Mds3p contributes to virulence and alkaline pH responses independently of the well-characterized Rim101p pH-response pathway.},

  abstract = {High-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) is the leading cause of mortality from gynecological malignancies, due to diagnosis at a metastatic stage. Current screening options fail to improve mortality due to the absence of early-stage-specific biomarkers. We postulated that a liquid biopsy, such as utero-tubal lavage (UtL), may identify localized lesions better than systemic approaches of serum/plasma analysis. Furthermore, while mutation-based assays are challenged by the rarity of tumor DNA within non-mutated DNA, analyzing the proteomic profile, is expected to enable earlier detection, as it reveals perturbations in both the tumor as well as in its microenvironment. To attain deep proteomic coverage and overcome the high dynamic range of this body fluid, we applied our method for microvesicle proteomics to the UtL samples. Liquid biopsies from HGOC patients (n=49) and controls (n=127) were divided into a discovery and validation sets. Data-dependent analysis of the samples on the Q-Exactive mass spectrometer provided depth of 8,578 UtL proteins in total, and on average \textasciitilde{}3,000 proteins per sample. We used support vector machine algorithms for sample classification, and crossed three feature-selection algorithms, to construct and validate a 9-protein classifier with 70\% sensitivity and 76.2\% specificity. The signature correctly identified all Stage I lesions. These results demonstrate the potential power of microvesicle-based proteomic biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis.},

Cell-derived mimetic nanovesicles (M-NVs) are a potentially promising alternative to exosomes for clinical applicability, demonstrating higher yield without incumbent production and isolation issues. Although several studies have shown that M-NVs have similar morphology, size and therapeutic potential compared to exosomes, comprehensive characterization and to what extent M-NVs components mimic exosomes remain elusive. M-NVs were generated through the extrusion of cells and proteomic profiling demonstrated an enrichment of proteins associated with membrane and cytosolic components. The proteomic data herein reveal a subset of proteins that are highly abundant in M-NVs in comparison to exosomes. M-NVs contain proteins that largely represent the parental cell proteome, whereas the profile of exosomal proteins highlight their endosomally derived origin. This advantage of M-NVs alleviates the necessity of endosomal sorting of endogenous therapeutic proteins or RNA into exosomes. This study also highlights differences in protein post-translational modifications among M-NVs, as distinct from exosomes. Overall this study provides key insights into defining the proteome composition of M-NVs as a distinct from exosomes, and the potential advantage of M-NVs as an alternative nanocarrier when spontaneous endosomal sorting of therapeutics are limited.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication, and in mammals are generally classified as \textasciitilde{}50-150nm exosomes, \textasciitilde{}100-1000nm microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, each arising as a result of different biological processes. EVs carry protein, lipids, and nucleic acids within the circulation, to target cells whereupon they mediate physiological changes. Due to their small size, quantification and characterization by conventional microscopy is not possible. However, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) has provided a method to determine the fluid concentration and size of extracellular vesicles and other nanoparticles. While NTA provides statistical summaries of samples in an experiment, a recurring difficulty is the organization, manipulation, and management of raw particle count data because of the large size of datasets, and resultant vulnerability to user error. To address these limitations, we developed tidyNano, an R package that provides functions to import, clean, and quickly summarize raw NanoSight (Malvern Panalytical) data for efficient calculation of statistics and visualization. Here, we provide a framework for importing raw nanoparticle data and provide functions to facilitate rapid and efficient analysis, visualization and calculation of summary statistics. tidyNano was used to analyze murine plasma extracellular vesicles across gestation by aggregating and summarizing samples based on technical, biological and gestational parameters. In addition, we developed shinySIGHT, a Shiny web application that allows for interactive exploration and visualization of EV data. Using this package, we analyzed data generated from 36 samples of EV derived from the plasma of mice across gestation. Peripheral EV concentration increased linearly across pregnancy, with trending increases as early as gestation day (GD) 5.5 and significant rises at GD14.5, and 17.5 relative to EV concentrations in nonpregnant females. Thus, the data highlight the utility of the mouse as a model of EV biology in pregnancy. Further, the package provides a mechanism for seamless analysis of EV data generated by NanoSight. Importantly, this package provides a straightforward framework by which diverse types of large datasets can be simply and efficiently analyzed. tidyNano and shinySIGHT are freely available under the MIT license and is hosted on GitHub (https://nguyens7.github.io/tidyNano/).{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  title = {Plasma Membrane Architecture Protects {{Candida}} Albicans from Killing by Copper},
  volume = {15},
  issn = {1553-7404},
  abstract = {The ability to resist copper toxicity is important for microbial pathogens to survive attack by innate immune cells. A sur7{$\Delta$} mutant of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans exhibits decreased virulence that correlates with increased sensitivity to copper, as well as defects in other stress responses and morphogenesis. Previous studies indicated that copper kills sur7{$\Delta$} cells by a mechanism distinct from the known resistance pathways involving the Crp1 copper exporter or the Cup1 metallothionein. Since Sur7 resides in punctate plasma membrane domains known as MCC/eisosomes, we examined overexpression of SUR7 and found that it rescued the copper sensitivity of a mutant that fails to form MCC/eisosomes (pil1{$\Delta$} lsp1{$\Delta$}), indicating that these domains act to facilitate Sur7 function. Genetic screening identified new copper-sensitive mutants, the strongest of which were similar to sur7{$\Delta$} in having altered plasma membranes due to defects in membrane trafficking, cortical actin, and morphogenesis (rvs161{$\Delta$}, rvs167{$\Delta$}, and arp2{$\Delta$} arp3{$\Delta$}). Consistent with the mutants having altered plasma membrane organization, they were all more readily permeabilized by copper, which is known to bind phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine and cause membrane damage. Although these phospholipids are normally localized to the intracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane, their exposure on the surface of the copper-sensitive mutants was indicated by increased susceptibility to membrane damaging agents that bind to these phospholipids. Increased copper sensitivity was also detected for a drs2{$\Delta$} mutant, which lacks a phospholipid flippase that is involved in maintaining phospholipid asymmetry. Copper binds phosphatidylserine with very high affinity, and deleting CHO1 to prevent phosphatidylserine synthesis rescued the copper sensitivity of sur7{$\Delta$} cells, confirming a major role for phosphatidylserine in copper sensitivity. These results highlight how proper plasma membrane architecture protects fungal pathogens from copper and attack by the immune system, thereby opening up new avenues for therapeutic intervention.},

  issn = {1059-1524},
  abstract = {Rapid and long-distance secretion of membrane components is critical for hyphal formation in filamentous fungi, but the mechanisms responsible for polarized trafficking are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that in Candida albicans, the majority of the Golgi complex is redistributed to the distal region during hyphal formation. Randomly distributed Golgi puncta in yeast cells cluster toward the growing tip during hyphal formation, remain associated with the distal portion of the filament during its extension, and are almost absent from the cell body. This restricted Golgi localization pattern is distinct from other organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum, vacuole and mitochondria, which remain distributed throughout the cell body and hypha. Hyphal-induced positioning of the Golgi and the maintenance of its structural integrity requires actin cytoskeleton, but not microtubules. Absence of the formin Bni1 causes a hyphal-specific dispersal of the Golgi into a haze of finely dispersed vesicles with a sedimentation density no different from that of normal Golgi. These results demonstrate the existence of a hyphal-specific, Bni1-dependent cue for Golgi integrity and positioning at the distal portion of the hyphal tip, and suggest that filamentous fungi have evolved a novel strategy for polarized secretion, involving a redistribution of the Golgi to the growing tip.},

  abstract = {In eukaryotes, the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is a major cytosolic cuproprotein with a small fraction residing in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) to protect against respiratory superoxide. Curiously, the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans is predicted to express two cytosolic SODs including Cu/Zn containing SOD1 and manganese containing SOD3. As part of a copper starvation response, C. albicans represses SOD1 and induces the non-copper alternative SOD3. While both SOD1 and SOD3 are predicted to exist in the same cytosolic compartment, their potential role in mitochondrial oxidative stress had yet to be investigated. We show here that under copper replete conditions, a fraction of the Cu/Zn containing SOD1 localizes to the mitochondrial IMS to guard against mitochondrial superoxide. However in copper starved cells, localization of the manganese containing SOD3 is restricted to the cytosol leaving the mitochondrial IMS devoid of SOD. We observe that during copper starvation, an alternative oxidase (AOX) form of respiration is induced that is not coupled to ATP synthesis but maintains mitochondrial superoxide at low levels even in the absence of IMS SOD. Surprisingly, the copper-dependent cytochrome c oxidase (COX) form of respiration remains high with copper starvation. We provide evidence that repression of SOD1 during copper limitation serves to spare copper for COX and maintain COX respiration. Overall, the complex copper starvation response of C. albicans involving SOD1, SOD3 and AOX minimizes mitochondrial oxidative damage whilst maximizing COX respiration essential for fungal pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {Hsp12p is considered to be a small heat shock protein and conserved among fungal species. To investigate the expression of this heat shock protein in the fungal pathogen Candida albicans we developed an anti-CaHsp12p antibody. We show that this protein is induced during stationary phase growth and under stress conditions including heat shock, osmotic, oxidative and heavy metal stress. Furthermore, we find that CaHsp12p expression is influenced by the quorum sensing molecule farnesol, the change of CO2 concentration and pH. Notably we show that the key transcription factor Efg1p acts as a positive regulator of CaHsp12p in response to heat shock and oxidative stress and demonstrate that CaHsp12p expression is additionally modulated by Hog1p and the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. To study the function of Hsp12p in C. albicans we generated a null mutant, in which all four CaHSP12 genes have been deleted. Phenotypic analysis of the strain shows that CaHSP12 is not essential for stress resistance, morphogenesis or virulence when tested in a Drosophila model of infection. However, when overexpressed, CaHSP12 significantly enhanced cell-cell adhesion, germ tube formation and susceptibility to azole antifungal agents whilst desensitizing C. albicans to the quorum sensing molecule farnesol.},

  abstract = {Candida albicans is a major cause of invasive fungal infections worldwide. Upon infection and when in contact with human plasma as well as body fluids the fungus is challenged by the activated complement system a central part of the human innate immune response. C. albicans controls and evades host complement attack by binding several human complement regulators like Factor H, Factor H-like protein 1 and C4BP to the surface. Gpm1 (Phosphoglycerate mutase 1) is one fungal Factor H/FHL1 -binding protein. As Gpm1 is surface exposed, we asked whether Gpm1 also contributes to host cell attachment. Here, we show by flow cytometry and by laser scanning microscopy that candida Gpm1 binds to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to keratinocytes (HaCaT), and also to monocytic U937 cells. Wild type candida did bind, but the candida gpm1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} knock-out mutant did not bind to these human cells. In addition Gpm1when attached to latex beads also conferred attachment to human endothelial cells. When analyzing Gpm1-binding to a panel of extracellular matrix proteins, the human glycoprotein vitronectin was identified as a new Gpm1 ligand. Vitronectin is a component of the extracellular matrix and also a regulator of the terminal complement pathway. Vitronectin is present on the surface of HUVEC and keratinocytes and acts as a surface ligand for fungal Gpm1. Gpm1 and vitronectin colocalize on the surface of HUVEC and HaCaT as revealed by laser scanning microscopy. The Gpm1 vitronectin interaction is inhibited by heparin and the interaction is also ionic strength dependent. Taken together, Gpm1 the candida surface protein binds to vitronectin and mediates fungal adhesion to human endothelial cells. Thus fungal Gpm1 and human vitronectin represent a new set of proteins that are relevant for fungal attachment to human cells interaction. Blockade of the Gpm1 vitronectin interaction might provide a new target for therapy.},

The Lpd1 protein, as visualized by a GFP-fusion, was localized in the mitochondria during the logarithmic yeast growth and the filamentous growth. The GFP signal was prevalent and relatively uniform toward the tip of the hyphae. The functions of the LPD1 gene were investigated by construction of lpd1/lpd1 mutant strain. This homozygous deletion mutant was unable to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources including glycerol, ethanol, acetate, and citrate. In addition, the lpd1/lpd1 strain exhibited a slow-growth phenotype on glucose-containing media and a marked sensitivity to 0.5mM of hydrogen peroxide. LPD1 was shown to be required for filamentous growth under a serum-containing hyphal-inducing condition.

This lipid is a major membrane component in the cell and is thought to play important roles in the growth and virulence of several fungal species. To investigate the importance of the methyl branch of the long-chain base in glucosylceramides in pathogenic fungi, we identified and characterized a sphingolipid C9-methyltransferase gene (MTS1, C9-MethylTransferase for Sphingolipid 1) in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. The mts1 disruptant lacked (E,E)-9-methylsphinga-4,8-dienine in its glucosylceramides and contained (E)-sphing-4-enine and (E,E)-sphinga-4,8-dienine. Reintroducing the MTS1 gene into the mts1 disruptant restored the synthesis of (E,E)-9-methylsphinga-4,8-dienine in the glucosylceramides. We also created a disruptant of the HSX11 gene, encoding glucosylceramide synthase, which catalyses the final step of glucosylceramide synthesis, in C. albicans and compared this mutant with the mts1 disruptant. The C. albicans mts1 and hsx11 disruptants both had a decreased hyphal growth rate compared to the wild-type strain. The hsx11 disruptant showed increased susceptibility to SDS and fluconazole, similar to a previously reported sld1 disruptant that contained only (E)-sphing-4-enine in its glucosylceramides, suggesting that these strains have defects in their cell membrane structures. In contrast, the mts1 disruptant grew similarly to wild-type in medium containing SDS or fluconazole. These results suggest that the C9-methyl group of a long-chain base in glucosylceramides plays an important role in the hyphal elongation of C. albicans independent of lipid membrane disruption.},

Consequently, branch formation in hyphal compartments is delayed until sufficient cytoplasm is synthesized to execute the G1 `START' function. To test the hypothesis that this mode of vacuole inheritance determines cell cycle progression and therefore the branching of hyphae, eight tetracycline-regulated conditional mutants were constructed that were affected at different stages of the vacuole inheritance pathway. Under repressing conditions, vac7, vac8 and fab1 mutants generated mycelial compartments with more symmetrically distributed vacuoles and increased branching frequencies. Repression of VAC1, VAM2 and VAM3 resulted in sparsely branched hyphae, with large vacuoles and enlarged hyphal compartments. Therefore, during hyphal growth of C. albicans the cell cycle, growth and branch formation can be uncoupled, resulting in the investment of cytoplasm to support hyphal extension at the expense of hyphal branching.},

Tetraspanins comprise a diverse family of four-pass transmembrane proteins that play critical roles in the immune, reproductive, genitourinary, and auditory systems. Despite their pervasive roles in human physiology, little is known about the structure of tetraspanins or the molecular mechanisms underlying their various functions. Here, we report the crystal structure of human CD81, a full-length tetraspanin. The transmembrane segments of CD81 pack as two largely separated pairs of helices, capped by the large extracellular loop (EC2) at the outer membrane leaflet. The two pairs of helices converge at the inner leaflet to create an intramembrane pocket with additional electron density corresponding to a~bound cholesterol molecule within the cavity. Molecular dynamics simulations identify an additional conformation in which EC2 separates substantially from the transmembrane domain. Cholesterol binding appears to modulate CD81 activity in cells, suggesting a potential mechanism for regulation of tetraspanin function.},

  abstract = {Tetraspanins are a superfamily of transmembrane proteins implicated in cellular development, motility, and activation through their interactions with a large range of proteins and with specific membrane microdomains. The complete three-dimensional structure of the tetraspanin CD81 has been predicted by molecular modeling and from the crystallographic structure of the EC2 large extracellular domain. Periodicity of sequence conservation, homology modeling, secondary structure prediction, and protein docking were used. The transmembrane domain appears organized as a four-stranded left-handed coiled coil directly connecting to two helices of the EC2. A smaller extracellular loop EC1 contains a small largely hydrophobic {$\beta$}-strand that packs in a conserved hydrophobic groove of the EC2. The palmitoylable intracellular N-terminal segment forms an amphipathic membrane-parallel helix. Structural variability occurs mainly in an hypervariable subdomain of the EC2 and in intracellular regions. Therefore, the variable interaction selectivity of tetraspanins originates both from sequence variability within structurally conserved domains and from the occurrence of small structurally variable domains. In CD81 and other tetraspanins, the numerous membrane-exposed aromatic residues are asymmetrically clustered and protrude on one side of the transmembrane domain. This may represent a functional specialization of these two sides for interactions with cholesterol, proteins, or membrane microdomains.},

Since palmitoylation occurs on intracellular cysteine residues, we examined whether mutating these residues in the human tetraspanin CD81 would affect the association of CD81 with other surface membrane proteins. Mutation of at least six of the eight juxtamembrane cysteines was required to completely eliminate detectable CD81 palmitoylation, indicating that several sites can be palmitoylated. Interestingly, these mutated proteins exhibited reduced cell surface detection by antibody compared to wild-type CD81, but this was not due to differences in the level of protein expression, trafficking to the cell surface, protein stability, or anti-CD81 antibody binding affinity. Instead, the mutant CD81 proteins appeared to be partially hidden from detection by anti-CD81 antibody, presumably due to altered interactions with other proteins at the cell surface. Associations with the known CD81-interacting proteins CD9 and EWI-2 were also impaired with the mutant CD81 proteins. Taken together, these findings indicate that mutation of juxtamembrane cysteines alters the interaction of CD81 with other proteins, either because of reduced palmitoylation, structural alterations in the mutant proteins, or a combination of both factors, and this affects the CD81 microenvironment on the cell surface.},

We previously used a tetracycline-inducible stable mammalian cell line, HEK293S-TetR, for regulated high-level expression of G-protein coupled receptors. We here report successfully using this method for high-level expression of de novo oligo-DNA assembled human CD81 gene. CD81 is a member of the vital tetraspanin membrane protein family. It has recently been identified as the putative receptor for the Hepatitis C Virus envelope E2 glycoprotein (HCV-E2). In this study we used a single-step rho-1D4-affinity purification method to obtain {$>$}95\% purity from HEK293S-TetR-inducible stable cell lines. Using ELISA assay we determined that the affinity of the purified CD81 receptor for HCV-E2 protein is 3.8{$\pm$}1.2 nM. Using fluorescent confocal microscopy we showed that the inducibly overexpressed CD81 receptor in HEK293S-TetR cells is correctly located on the plasma membrane. We demonstrated that the combination of high-level expression of CD81 with efficient single-step immunoaffinity purification is a useful method for obtaining large quantities of CD81 membrane receptor suitable for detailed structural analyses of this elusive tetraspanin protein. Furthermore, this simple single-step immunoaffinity purification to high purity of membrane protein could be useful broadly for other membrane protein purifications, thus accelerating the determination of structures for large numbers of difficult-to-obtain membrane proteins.},

More recently, it has been suggested that CD81 is necessary but not sufficient for HCV entry into target cells. Here we present further evidence that putative human hepatocyte-specific factors act in concert with CD81 to mediate sE2 binding and HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) entry. Moreover, we show that CD81-mediated HCVpp entry entails E2 binding to residues in the large extracellular loop as well as molecular events mediated by the transmembrane and intracellular domains of CD81. The concept that CD81 receptor function progresses in stages is further supported by our finding that anti-CD81 monoclonal antibodies inhibit HCVpp entry by different mechanisms. The half-life of CD81-HCVpp binding was determined to be approximately 17 min, and we propose that binding is followed by CD81 oligomerization, partitioning into cholesterol-rich membrane domains, or other, lateral protein-protein interactions. This results in the formation of a receptor-virus complex that undergoes endocytosis and pH-dependent membrane fusion.},

In this study, Huh7 cells expressing wild-type or palmitoylation-defective CD81 were generated to analyze whether palmitoylation of CD81 is involved in HCV cell entry. Our data showed that de-palmitoylation of CD81 dramatically reduced its association with tetraspanin CD151, but did not influence CD81 partition in detergent-resistant membranes. Moreover, de-palmitoylated CD81 decreased the host cell susceptibility to HCV. Notably, CD151-specific antibodies and siRNA inhibited HCV cell entry, and detachment of CD81 with CD151 decreased the lateral movement of virus particle/CD81 complex to areas of cell\textendash{}cell contact.

  abstract = {BackgroundThe risk of recurrence for endocrine-treated breast cancer patients persists for many years or even decades following surgery and apparently successful adjuvant therapy. This period of dormancy and acquired resistance is inherently difficult to investigate; previous efforts have been limited to in-vitro or in-vivo approaches. In this study, sequential tumour samples from patients receiving extended neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy were characterised as a novel clinical model.MethodsConsecutive tumour samples from 62 patients undergoing extended (4\textendash{}45 months) neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy with letrozole were subjected to transcriptomic and proteomic analysis, representing before ({$\leq$} 0), early (13\textendash{}120 days), and long-term ({$>$} 120 days) neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy with letrozole. Patients with at least a 40\% initial reduction in tumour size by 4 months of treatment were included. Of these, 42 patients with no subsequent progression were classified as ``dormant'', and the remaining 20 patients as ``acquired resistant''.ResultsChanges in gene expression in dormant tumours begin early and become more pronounced at later time points. Therapy-induced changes in resistant tumours were common features of treatment, rather than being specific to the resistant phenotype. Comparative analysis of long-term treated dormant and resistant tumours highlighted changes in epigenetics pathways including DNA methylation and histone acetylation. The DNA methylation marks 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine were significantly reduced in resistant tumours compared with dormant tissues after extended letrozole treatment.ConclusionsThis is the first patient-matched gene expression study investigating long-term aromatase inhibitor-induced dormancy and acquired resistance in breast cancer. Dormant tumours continue to change during treatment whereas acquired resistant tumours more closely resemble their diagnostic samples. Global loss of DNA methylation was observed in resistant tumours under extended treatment. Epigenetic alterations may lead to escape from dormancy and drive acquired resistance in a subset of patients, supporting a potential role for therapy targeted at these epigenetic alterations in the management of resistance to oestrogen deprivation therapy.},

In the fungus Candida albicans, the Rho-family small GTPase, Cdc42, is essential for polarized hyphal growth and Ca2+ influx is required for the tropic responses of hyphae to environmental cues, but the regulatory link between these systems is unclear. In this study, the interaction between Ca2+ influx and Cdc42 polarity-complex dynamics was investigated using hyphal galvanotropic and thigmotropic responses as reporter systems. During polarity establishment in an applied electric field, cathodal emergence of hyphae was lost when either of the two Cdc42 apical recycling pathways was disrupted by deletion of Rdi1, a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, or Bnr1, a formin, but was completely restored by extracellular Ca2+. Loss of the Cdc42 GTPase activating proteins, Rga2 and Bem3, also abolished cathodal polarization, but this was not rescued by Ca2+. Expression of GTP-locked Cdc42 reversed the polarity of hypha emergence from cathodal to anodal, an effect augmented by Ca2+. The cathodal directional cue therefore requires Cdc42 GTP hydrolysis. Ca2+ influx amplifies Cdc42-mediated directional growth signals, in part by augmenting Cdc42 apical trafficking. The Ca2+-binding EF-hand motif in Cdc24, the Cdc42 activator, was essential for growth in yeast cells but not in established hyphae.

  volume = {15},
  issn = {1553-7404},
  abstract = {Candida albicans is among the most common causes of human fungal infections and is an important source of mortality. C. albicans is able to diminish its detection by innate immune cells through masking of {$\beta$} (1,3)-glucan in the inner cell wall with an outer layer of heavily glycosylated mannoproteins (mannan). However, mutations or drugs that disrupt the cell wall can lead to exposure of {$\beta$} (1,3)-glucan (unmasking) and enhanced detection by innate immune cells through receptors like Dectin-1, the C-type signaling lectin. Previously, our lab showed that the pathway for synthesizing the phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) plays a role in {$\beta$} (1,3)-glucan masking. The homozygous PS synthase knockout mutant, cho1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$}, exhibits increased exposure of {$\beta$} (1,3)-glucan. Several Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathways and their upstream Rho-type small GTPases are important for regulating cell wall biogenesis and remodeling. In the cho1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} mutant, both the Cek1 and Mkc1 MAPKs are constitutively activated, and they act downstream of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rho1, respectively. In addition, Cdc42 activity is up-regulated in cho1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$}. Thus, it was hypothesized that activation of Cdc42 or Rho1 and their downstream kinases cause unmasking. Disruption of MKC1 does not decrease unmasking in cho1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$}, and hyperactivation of Rho1 in wild-type cells increases unmasking and activation of both Cek1 and Mkc1. Moreover, independent hyperactivation of the MAP kinase kinase kinase Ste11 in wild-type cells leads to Cek1 activation and increased {$\beta$} (1,3)-glucan exposure. Thus, upregulation of the Cek1 MAPK pathway causes unmasking, and may be responsible for unmasking in cho1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$}.},

  abstract = {BackgroundProtein secretion is a fundamental process in all living cells. Gluconeogenic enzymes are secreted when Saccharomyces cerevisiae are grown in media containing low glucose. However, when cells are transferred to media containing high glucose, they are internalized. We investigated whether or not gluconeogenic enzymes were associated with extracellular vesicles in glucose-starved cells. We also examined the role that the endocytosis gene END3 plays in the internalization of extracellular proteins/vesicles in response to glucose addition.MethodsTransmission electron microscopy was performed to determine the presence of extracellular vesicles in glucose-starved wild-type cells and the dynamics of vesicle transport in cells lacking the END3 gene. Proteomics was used to identify extracellular proteins that associated with these vesicles.ResultsTotal extracts prepared from glucose-starved cells consisted of about 95\% small vesicles (30\textendash{}50 nm) and 5\% large structures (100\textendash{}300 nm). The addition of glucose caused a rapid decline in small extracellular vesicles in wild-type cells. However, most of the extracellular vesicles were still observed in cells lacking the END3 gene following glucose replenishment. Proteomics was used to identify 72 extracellular proteins that may be associated with these vesicles. Gluconeogenic enzymes fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate lyase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, as well as non-gluconeogenic enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and cyclophilin A, were distributed in the vesicle-enriched fraction in total extracts prepared from cells grown in low glucose. Distribution of these proteins in the vesicle-enriched fraction required the integrity of the membranes. When glucose was added to glucose-starved wild-type cells, levels of extracellular fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate lyase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and cyclophilin A were reduced. In contrast, in cells lacking the END3 gene, levels of these proteins in the extracellular fraction remained high.ConclusionThe END3 gene is required for the rapid decline of extracellular proteins and vesicles in response to glucose addition.},

Research in this field has grown rapidly in the last few years, and there is a plethora of techniques for the isolation and characterization of EVs, many of which are poorly standardized. EVs are heterogeneous in size, origin and molecular constituents, with considerable overlap in size and phenotype between different populations of EVs. Little is known about current practices for the isolation, purification and characterization of EVs. We report here the first large, detailed survey of current worldwide practices for the isolation and characterization of EVs. Conditioned cell culture media was the most widely used material (83\%). Ultracentrifugation remains the most commonly used isolation method (81\%) with 59\% of respondents use a combination of methods. Only 9\% of respondents used only 1 characterization method, with others using 2 or more methods. Sample volume, sample type and downstream application all influenced the isolation and characterization techniques employed.},

  abstract = {Candidemia has become an important bloodstream infection that is frequently associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity, and its growing incidence is related to complex medical and surgical procedures. We conducted a multicenter study in five tertiary care teaching hospitals in Italy and Spain and evaluated the epidemiology, species distribution, antifungal susceptibilities, and outcomes of candidemia episodes. In the period of 2008 to 2010, 995 episodes of candidemia were identified in these hospitals. The overall incidence of candidemia was 1.55 cases per 1,000 admissions and remained stable during the 3-year analysis. Candida albicans was the leading agent of infection (58.4\%), followed by Candida parapsilosis complex (19.5\%), Candida tropicalis (9.3\%), and Candida glabrata (8.3\%). The majority of the candidemia episodes were found in the internal medicine department (49.6\%), followed by the surgical ward, the intensive care unit (ICU), and the hemato-oncology ward. Out of 955 patients who were eligible for evaluation, 381 (39.9\%) died within 30 days from the onset of candidemia. Important differences in the 30-day mortality rates were noted between institutions: the lowest mortality rate was in the Barcelona hospital, and the highest rate was in the Udine hospital (33.6\% versus 51\%, respectively; P = 0.0005). Overall, 5.1\% of the 955 isolates tested were resistant or susceptible dose dependent (SDD) to fluconazole, with minor differences between the hospitals in Italy and Spain (5.7\% versus 3.5\%, respectively; P = 0.2). Higher MICs for caspofungin were found, especially with C. parapsilosis complex (MIC90, 1 {$\mu$}g/ml). Amphotericin B had the lowest MICs. This report shows that candidemia is a significant source of morbidity in Europe, causing a substantial burden of disease and mortality.},

We hypothesize that exosomes-like vesicles (EV) could mediate this rapid modification. EV are membrane-derived vesicles carrying lipids, proteins, mRNAs and microRNAs and have been recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication. Although it has been assumed for a long time that fungi release EV, knowledge of their functions is still limited. In this work we analyze P. fermentans EV production during growth in two different media containing urea (YCU) or methionine (YCM) where yeast-like or pseudohyphal morphology are produced. We developed a procedure to extract EV from the neighboring biofilm which is faster and more efficient as compared to the widely used ultracentrifugation method. Differences in morphology and RNA content of EV suggest that they might have an active role during dimorphic transition as response to the growth conditions. Our findings are coherent with a general state of hypoxic stress of the pseudohyphal cells.},

Fungi grow with a variety of morphologies: oval yeast cells, chains of elongated cells called pseudohyphae and long, narrow, tube-like filaments called hyphae. In filamentous fungi, hyphal growth is strongly polarised to the tip and is mediated by the Spitzenk{\"o}rper, which acts as a supply centre to concentrate the delivery of secretory vesicles to the tip. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, polarised growth is mediated by the polarisome, a surface cap of proteins that nucleates the formation of actin cables delivering secretory vesicles to the growing tip. The human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, can grow in all three morphological forms. Here we show the presence of a Spitzenk{\"o}rper at the tip of C. albicans hyphae as a ball-like localisation of secretory vesicles, together with the formin Bni1 and Mlc1, an ortholog of an S. cerevisiae myosin regulatory light chain. In contrast, in C. albicans yeast cells, pseudohyphae and hyphae Spa2 and Bud6, orthologs of S. cerevisiae polarisome components, as well as the master morphology regulator Cdc42, localise predominantly, but not exclusively, to a surface cap resembling the polarisome of S. cerevisiae yeast cells. A small amount of Cdc42 also localises to the Spitzenk{\"o}rper. Furthermore, we show differences in the genetic and cytoskeletal requirements, and cell cycle dynamics of polarity determinants in yeast, pseudohyphae and hyphae. These results, together with the cytological differences between the cell types, suggest that the Spitzenk{\"o}rper and polarisome are distinct structures, that the polarisome and Spitzenk{\"o}rper coexist in hyphae, and that polarised growth in hyphae is driven by a fundamentally different mechanism to that in yeast and pseudohyphae.},

Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted upon fusion of endosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane. The mechanisms involved in their biogenesis have not yet been fully identified although they could be used to modulate exosome formation and therefore are a promising tool in understanding exosome functions. We have performed an RNA interference screen targeting 23 components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery and associated proteins in MHC class II (MHC II)-expressing HeLa-CIITA cells. Silencing of HRS, STAM1 or TSG101 reduced the secretion of EV-associated CD63 and MHC II but each gene altered differently the size and/or protein composition of secreted EVs, as quantified by immuno-electron microscopy. By contrast, depletion of VPS4B augmented this secretion while not altering the features of EVs. For several other ESCRT subunits, it was not possible to draw any conclusions about their involvement in exosome biogenesis from the screen. Interestingly, silencing of ALIX increased MHC II exosomal secretion, as a result of an overall increase in intracellular MHC II protein and mRNA levels. In human dendritic cells (DCs), ALIX depletion also increased MHC II in the cells, but not in the released CD63-positive EVs. Such differences could be attributed to a greater heterogeneity in size, and higher MHC II and lower CD63 levels in vesicles recovered from DCs as compared with HeLa-CIITA. The results reveal a role for selected ESCRT components and accessory proteins in exosome secretion and composition by HeLa-CIITA. They also highlight biogenetic differences in vesicles secreted by a tumour cell line and primary DCs.},

Tetraspanins are a family of proteins with four transmembrane domains that play a role in many aspects of cell biology and physiology; they are also used by several pathogens for infection and regulate cancer progression. Many tetraspanins associate specifically and directly with a limited number of proteins, and also with other tetraspanins, thereby generating a hierarchical network of interactions. Through these interactions, tetraspanins are believed to have a role in cell and membrane compartmentalization. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster, we describe the basic principles underlying tetraspanin-based assemblies and highlight examples of how tetraspanins regulate the trafficking and function of their partner proteins that are required for the normal development and function of several organs, including, in humans, the eye, the kidney and the immune system.},

  abstract = {The development of exosomes as delivery vehicles requires understanding how and where exogenously administered exosomes are distributed in vivo. In the present study, we designed a fusion protein consisting of Gaussia luciferase and a truncated lactadherin, gLuc-lactadherin, and constructed a plasmid expressing the fusion protein. B16-BL6 murine melanoma cells were transfected with the plasmid, and exosomes released from the cells were collected by ultracentrifugation. Strong luciferase activity was detected in the fraction containing exosomes, indicating their efficient labeling with gLuc-lactadherin. Then, the labeled B16-BL6 exosomes were intravenously injected into mice, and their tissue distribution was evaluated. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the exosome blood concentration\textendash{}time profile revealed that B16-BL6 exosomes disappeared very quickly from the blood circulation with a half-life of approximately 2min. Little luciferase activity was detected in the serum at 4h after exosome injection, suggesting rapid clearance of B16-BL6 exosomes in vivo. Moreover, sequential in vivo imaging revealed that the B16-BL6 exosome-derived signals distributed first to the liver and then to the lungs. These results indicate that gLuc-lactadherin labeling is useful for tracing exosomes in vivo and that B16-BL6 exosomes are rapidly cleared from the blood circulation after systemic administration.},

Interestingly, activation of H1R1 in HeLa cells increases Ser110 phosphorylation of SNAP23, promoting MVB\textendash{}PM fusion and the release of CD63-enriched exosomes. Using this single-cell resolution approach, we highlight the modulatory dynamics of MVB exocytosis that will help to increase our understanding of exosome physiology and identify druggable targets in exosome-associated pathologies.},

Calcium signaling is an intriguing aspect in its physiology, attributing to the roles in stress response and morphogenesis. Until recently, little was known about the mechanisms by which the calcium signaling-associated elements affect its pathogenicity. In this study, we found that Yvc1, a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family, localized on the vacuolar membrane. The yvc1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} mutant displayed decreased ability of stress response, morphogenesis and attenuated virulence. The Spitzenk{\"o}rper required for polarized growth were not detected in the hyphal tip of this mutant, suggesting a key role of Yvc1 in hyphal polarized growth and re-orientation to host signals. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the putative vacuolar calcium channel Yvc1 plays an important role in C. albicans infection and survival in host tissues, which is associated with its pleiotropic effects in several fungal physiological processes, including stress response, morphogenesis, and polarized growth.},

  volume = {17},
  issn = {1201-9712},
  abstract = {Summary
Background
Studies on candidemia occurring among adults in Southern African are limited. We aimed to document the epidemiology of candidemia among adults in Soweto.
Methods
This was a retrospective hospital-based study in three discrete periods, involving 9 years, from 1990 to 2007.
Results
Two hundred and sixty-six patients were identified. Case rates were 2.8 cases/10~000 admissions in 1998\textendash{}2002 and 3.6 episodes/10~000 hospitalizations in 2005\textendash{}2007. In 1990, Candida albicans caused 62\% and Candida tropicalis caused 23\% of episodes. In 2005\textendash{}2007, major species were C. albicans (46\%), Candida parapsilosis (25\%), and Candida glabrata (23\%), with little change compared to 1998\textendash{}2002. Major predisposing conditions were abdominal surgery (43\%), HIV infection (19\% in 2005\textendash{}2007), trauma (16\%), diabetes mellitus (12\%), and cancer (8\%). General wards superseded intensive care as the major diagnostic setting in 2005\textendash{}2007. The crude mortality was 60\%. Among 22 HIV-infected patients with a median CD4 cell count of 68/{$\mu$}l, three were of community-onset. C. albicans caused 73\% of cases. Five patients had another predisposing condition and five had central venous catheters. The mortality was 73\%.
Conclusions
Soweto has a pattern of Candida species different from other continents. HIV infection and trauma were important predisposing conditions.},

  title = {A Novel Ex Vivo Immunoproteomic Approach Characterising {{Fasciola}} Hepatica Tegumental Antigens Identified Using Immune Antibody from Resistant Sheep},
  volume = {47},
  issn = {0020-7519},
  abstract = {A more thorough understanding of the immunological interactions between Fasciola spp. and their hosts is required if we are to develop new immunotherapies to control fasciolosis. Deeper knowledge of the antigens that are the target of the acquired immune responses of definitive hosts against both Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica will potentially identify candidate vaccine antigens. Indonesian Thin Tail sheep express a high level of acquired immunity to infection by F. gigantica within 4weeks of infection and antibodies in Indonesian Thin Tail sera can promote antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against the surface tegument of juvenile F. gigantica in vitro. Given the high protein sequence similarity between F. hepatica and F. gigantica, we hypothesised that antibody from F. gigantica-infected sheep could be used to identify the orthologous proteins in the tegument of F. hepatica. Purified IgG from the sera of F. gigantica-infected Indonesian Thin Tail sheep collected pre-infection and 4weeks p.i. were incubated with live adult F. hepatica ex vivo and the immunosloughate (immunoprecipitate) formed was isolated and analysed via liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry to identify proteins involved in the immune response. A total of 38 proteins were identified at a significantly higher abundance in the immunosloughate using week 4 IgG, including eight predicted membrane proteins, 20 secreted proteins, nine proteins predicted to be associated with either the lysosomes, the cytoplasm or the cytoskeleton and one protein with an unknown cellular localization. Three of the membrane proteins are transporters including a multidrug resistance protein, an amino acid permease and a glucose transporter. Interestingly, a total of 21 of the 38 proteins matched with proteins recently reported to be associated with the proposed small exosome-like extracellular vesicles of adult F. hepatica, suggesting that the Indonesian Thin Tail week 4 IgG is either recognising individual proteins released from extracellular vesicles or is immunoprecipitating intact exosome-like extracellular vesicles. Five extracellular vesicle membrane proteins were identified including two proteins predicted to be associated with vesicle transport/ exocytosis (VPS4, vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4b and the Niemann-Pick C1 protein). RNAseq analysis of the developmental transcription of the 38 immunosloughate proteins showed that the sequences are expressed over a wide abundance range with 21/38 transcripts expressed at a relatively high level from metacercariae to the adult life cycle stage. A notable feature of the immunosloughates was the absence of cytosolic proteins which have been reported to be secreted markers for damage to adult flukes incubated in vitro, suggesting that the proteins observed are not inadvertent contaminants leaking from damaged flukes ex vivo. The identification of tegument protein antigens shared between F. gigantica and F. hepatica is beneficial in terms of the possible development of a dual purpose vaccine effective against both fluke species.},

Candidemia occurred in ICU in 1,206 patients (48.1 \%). When comparing ICU vs. non-ICU patients, the former had significantly more frequent surgery during the past 30 days, were more often preexposed to fluconazole and treated with echinocandin, and were less frequently infected with C. parapsilosis. Risk factors and age remained unchanged during the study period. A significant increased incidence in the overall population and ICU was found. The odds of being infected with a given species in ICU was influenced by risk factors and preexposure to fluconazole and caspofungin. Echinocandins initial therapy increased over time in ICU (4.6 \% first year of study, to 48.5 \% last year of study, p {$<$} 0.0001). ICU patients had a higher day-30 death rate than non-ICU patients (odds ratio [OR] 2.12; 95 \% confidence interval [CI] 1.66\textendash{}2.72; p {$<$} 0.0001). The day-30 and early ({$<$}day 8) death rates increased over time in ICU (from 41.5 \% the first to 56.9 \% the last year of study (p = 0.001) and 28.7\textendash{}38.8 \% (p = 0.0292), respectively). Independent risk factors for day-30 death in ICU were age, arterial catheter, Candida species, preexposure to caspofungin, and lack of antifungal therapy at the time of blood cultures results (p {$<$} 0.05).ConclusionsThe availability of new antifungals and the publication of numerous guidelines did not prevent an increase of candidemia and death in ICU patients in the Paris area.},

  abstract = {Unlike other forms of candidiasis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, caused primarily by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, is a disease of immunocompetent and otherwise healthy women. Despite its prevalence, the fungal factors responsible for initiating symptomatic infection remain poorly understood. One of the hallmarks of vaginal candidiasis is the robust recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection, which seemingly do not clear the fungus, but rather exacerbate disease symptomatology. Candidalysin, a newly discovered peptide toxin secreted by C. albicans hyphae during invasion, drives epithelial damage, immune activation, and phagocyte attraction. Therefore, we hypothesized that Candidalysin is crucial for vulvovaginal candidiasis immunopathology. Anti-Candida immune responses are anatomical-site specific, as effective gastrointestinal, oral, and vaginal immunities are uniquely compartmentalized. Thus, we aimed to identify the immunopathologic role of Candidalysin and downstream signaling events at the vaginal mucosa. Microarray analysis of C. albicans-infected human vaginal epithelium in vitro revealed signaling pathways involved in epithelial damage responses, barrier repair, and leukocyte activation. Moreover, treatment of A431 vaginal epithelial cells with Candidalysin induced dose-dependent proinflammatory cytokine responses (including interleukin 1{$\alpha$} [IL-1{$\alpha$}], IL-1{$\beta$}, and IL-8), damage, and activation of c-Fos and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, consistent with fungal challenge. Mice intravaginally challenged with C. albicans strains deficient in Candidalysin exhibited no differences in colonization compared to isogenic controls. However, significant decreases in neutrophil recruitment, damage, and proinflammatory cytokine expression were observed with these strains. Our findings demonstrate that Candidalysin is a key hypha-associated virulence determinant responsible for the immunopathogenesis of C. albicans vaginitis.},

Previous studies have suggested that these extracellular vesicles are produced in vitro and during animal infection, but the role of vesicular secretion during the interaction of fungi with host cells remains unknown. In this report, we demonstrate by fluorescence microscopy that mammalian macrophages can incorporate extracellular vesicles produced by C. neoformans. Incubation of cryptococcal vesicles with murine macrophages resulted in increased levels of extracellular tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-{$\alpha$}), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and transforming growth factor {$\beta$} (TGF-{$\beta$}). Vesicle preparations also resulted in a dose-dependent stimulation of nitric oxide production by phagocytes, suggesting that vesicle components stimulate macrophages to produce antimicrobial compounds. Treated macrophages were more effective at killing C. neoformans yeast. Our results indicate that the extracellular vesicles of C. neoformans can stimulate macrophage function, apparently activating these phagocytic cells to enhance their antimicrobial activity.

  abstract = {The vacuole has crucial roles in stress resistance and adaptation of the fungal cell. Furthermore, in Candida albicans it has been observed to undergo dramatic expansion during the initiation of hyphal growth, to produce highly ``vacuolated'' subapical compartments. We hypothesized that these functions may be crucial for survival within the host and tissue-invasive hyphal growth. We also considered the role of the late endosome or prevacuole compartment (PVC), a distinct organelle involved in vacuolar and endocytic trafficking. We identified two Rab GTPases, encoded by VPS21 and YPT72, required for trafficking through the PVC and vacuole biogenesis, respectively. Deletion of VPS21 or YPT72 led to mild sensitivities to some cellular stresses. However, deletion of both genes resulted in a synthetic phenotype with severe sensitivity to cellular stress and impaired growth. Both the vps21{$\Delta$} and ypt72{$\Delta$} mutants had defects in filamentous growth, while the double mutant was completely deficient in polarized growth. The defects in hyphal growth were not suppressed by an ``active'' RIM101 allele or loss of the hyphal repressor encoded by TUP1. In addition, both single mutants had significant attenuation in a mouse model of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis, while the double mutant was rapidly cleared. Histological examination confirmed that the vps21{$\Delta$} and ypt72{$\Delta$} mutants are deficient in hyphal growth in vivo. We suggest that the PVC and vacuole are required on two levels during C. albicans infection: (i) stress resistance functions required for survival within tissue and (ii) a role in filamentous growth which may aid host tissue invasion.},

Five major peptides (T1 to T5) were shown to induce a vigorous proliferation of PBMC from the majority of the eight healthy human subjects tested. With the use of synthetic peptides, critical amino acid sequences of the two most immunoactive (T1 and T2) peptides were determined. Similar to what was found for the MP65 molecule, no PBMC multiplication was induced by the antigenic peptides in cultures of naive cord blood cells. The amino acid sequence analysis of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides of MP65 demonstrated a substantial homology with the deduced sequences of two cell wall proteins ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, encoded by the genesYRM305C and YGR279C. However, the antigenic peptides were those showing the least similarity with the corresponding regions of the above proteins. In particular, the lymphoproliferation-inducing sequence of the T1 peptide scored only 20\% identity with the homologous regions of S. cerevisiaeproteins. Besides disclosing the amino acid sequence of MP65, this study provides an initial characterization of some of its antigenic determinants, as well as of synthetic peptides of potential use to detect specific immune responses against MP65, a major target of anticandidal cell-mediated immunity in humans.},

In contrast to the situation in animal cells, mechanisms of secretion in fungi must include the capacity for trans-cell wall passage of macromolecules to the extracellular space. Although these mechanisms remain somewhat elusive, several studies in recent years have suggested that vesicular transport is required for trans-cell wall secretion of large molecules. Several fungal molecules, including proteins, lipids, polysaccharides and pigments, are released to the extracellular space in vesicles. In pathogenic fungi, a number of these vesicular components are associated with fungal virulence. Indeed, extracellular vesicles produced by fungi can interfere with the immunomodulatory activity of host cells. Fungal vesicles share many functional aspects with mammalian exosomes and extracellular vesicles produced by bacteria, plants and protozoa, but their cellular origin remains unknown. Here, we discuss the involvement of vesicular transport systems in fungal physiology and pathogenesis, making parallels with the mammalian, bacterial, protozoan and plant cell literature.},

In order to explore the function of Phr1p, we obtained a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion to determine its localization. During induction of vegetative growth, Phr1p-GFP was concentrated in the plasma membrane of the growing bud, in the mother-bud neck, and in the septum. Phr1p-GFP was recovered in the detergent-resistant membranes indicating its association with the lipid rafts as the wild type Phr1p. Upon induction of hyphal growth, Phr1p-GFP highly concentrated at the apex of the germ tubes and progressively distributed along the lateral sides of the hyphae. Phr1p-GFP also labelled the hyphal septa, where it colocalized with chitin. Localization to the hyphal septa was perturbed in nocodazole-treated cells, whereas inhibition of actin polymerization hindered the apical localization. Electron Microscopy analysis of the hyphal wall ultrastructure of a PHR1 null mutant showed loss of compactness and irregular organization of the surface layer. These observations indicate that Phr1p plays a crucial role in hyphal wall formation, a highly regulated process on which morphogenesis and virulence rely.},

  volume = {46},
  issn = {1087-1845},
  abstract = {Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated pathogenic fungus. The cryptococcal capsule is composed of polysaccharides and is necessary for virulence. It has been previously reported that glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), the major capsular component, is synthesized in cytoplasmic compartments and transported to the extracellular space in vesicles, but knowledge on the organelles involved in polysaccharide synthesis and traffic is extremely limited. In this paper we report the GXM distribution in C. neoformans cells sectioned by cryoultramicrotomy and visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and polysaccharide immunogold staining. Cryosections of fungal cells showed high preservation of intracellular organelles and cell wall structure. Incubation of cryosections with an antibody to GXM revealed that cytoplasmic structures associated to vesicular compartments and reticular membranes are in close proximity to the polysaccharide. GXM was generally found in association with the membrane of intracellular compartments and within different layers of the cell wall. Analysis of extracellular fractions from cryptococcal supernatants by transmission electron microscopy in combination with serologic, chromatographic and spectroscopic methods revealed fractions containing GXM and lipids. These results indicate an intimate association of GXM and lipids in both intracellular and extracellular spaces consistent with polysaccharide synthesis and transport in membrane-associated structures.},

  abstract = {Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that grows as budding yeast, pseudohyphal, and hyphal forms. In response to external signals, C. albicans switches rapidly among these forms. mRNA-containing cytoplasmic granules, termed processing bodies (P-bodies), have been reported to accumulate under various environmental stress conditions in diverse species from yeast to mammals. Here, we provide the first microscopic and genetic characterization of P-bodies in C. albicans. The core components of P-bodies, including the decapping machinery (Dcp2 and Dhh1), 5{${'}$}\textendash{}3{${'}$} exoribonuclease (Kem1/Xrn1), and the P-body scaffolding protein (Edc3), were identified and their localizations with respect to P-bodies were demonstrated. Various growth conditions, including glucose deprivation, hyperosmotic stress, and heat stress, stimulated the accumulation of P-bodies. In addition, we observed P-body aggregation during hyphal development. The deletion mutant strain edc3/edc3 had a defect in filamentation and exhibited a dramatic reduction in the number of P-bodies. These results suggest that Edc3 plays an essential role in the assembly and maintenance of P-bodies in C. albicans, and that the switch to filamentous growth appears to accompany P-body accumulation.},

However, there are still a few V-ATPase subunits and assembly factors that remain uncharacterized. In this study, we identified one of putative V-ATPase assembly factors, Vph2, and V0 subunit, Vma6, and explored their potential functions in C. albicans. Our results revealed that Vph2 and Vma6 were required for the correct distribution of V0 subunit Vph1 and V1 subunit Tfp1. Furthermore, Vph2 and Vma6 played an important role in endocytosis and vacuolar acidification. Disruption of VPH2 or VMA6 affected cell wall stress resistance and composition, accompanying induction of cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway. Besides, deletion of VPH2 or VMA6 led to weakened hyphal development in Spider medium that was not dependent on Hog1 activation. Moreover, the vph2{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} and vma6{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} mutants displayed attenuated virulence in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis. Taken together, our data indicated that Vph2 and Vma6 were essential for the proper localization of V-ATPase subunits, cell wall functions, filamentous growth and C. albicans pathogenesis, and provided the potential to better exploit V-ATPase-related proteins as antifungal targets.},

  volume = {49},
  issn = {1087-1845},
  abstract = {The cell wall of the yeast form of the dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is enriched with {$\alpha$}1,3-glucans. In Cryptococcus neoformans, {$\alpha$}1,3-glucans interact with glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), a heteropolysaccharide that is essential for fungal virulence. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of P. brasiliensis glycans sharing properties with cryptococcal GXM. Protein database searches in P. brasiliensis revealed the presence of sequences homologous to those coding for enzymes involved in the synthesis of GXM and capsular architecture in C. neoformans. In addition, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised to cryptococcal GXM bound to P. brasiliensis cells. Using protocols that were previously established for extraction and analysis of C. neoformans GXM, we recovered a P. brasiliensis glycan fraction composed of mannose and galactose, in addition to small amounts of glucose, xylose and rhamnose. In comparison with the C. neoformans GXM, the P. brasiliensis glycan fraction components had smaller molecular dimensions. The P. brasiliensis components, nevertheless, reacted with different GXM-binding mAbs. Extracellular vesicle fractions of P. brasiliensis also reacted with a GXM-binding mAb, suggesting that the polysaccharide-like molecule is exported to the extracellular space in secretory vesicles. An acapsular mutant of C. neoformans incorporated molecules from the P. brasiliensis extract onto the cell wall, resulting in the formation of surface networks that resembled the cryptococcal capsule. Coating the C. neoformans acapsular mutant with the P. brasiliensis glycan fraction resulted in protection against phagocytosis by murine macrophages. These results suggest that P. brasiliensis and C. neoformans share metabolic pathways required for the synthesis of similar polysaccharides and that P. brasiliensis yeast cell walls have molecules that mimic certain aspects of C. neoformans GXM. These findings are important because they provide additional evidence for the sharing of antigenically similar components across phylogenetically distant fungal species. Since GXM has been shown to be important for the pathogenesis of C. neoformans and to elicit protective antibodies, the finding of similar molecules in P. brasiliensis raises the possibility that these glycans play similar functions in paracoccidiomycosis.},

We examined the growth of these cells in a range of conditions. Depletion of Rho1p from yeast cells resulted in cell death, lysis, and aggregation. The Rho1p conditional mutant was inviable on 10\% serum indicating that Rho1p was also required for hyphal viability. Furthermore, in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis, strains dependent on pPCK1-driven RHO1 expression failed to colonise the kidneys and establish disease, suggesting that the level of glucose in serum was sufficient to repress the pPCK1 and that Rho1p-depleted strains were inviable within the host.

Scanning electron microscopy revealed that {$\Delta$}cph1, {$\Delta$}hst7 and {$\Delta$}cst20 mutants were able to filament and form structured biofilms displaying three-dimensional architecture similar to those formed by wild-type strains. However, {$\Delta$}efg1 and {$\Delta$}cph1/{$\Delta$}efg1 mutants were unable to filament and did not form biofilms, but rather sparse monolayers of loosely attached elongated, rod-like, cells. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed intrinsic resistance of all mutant strains to fluconazole and amphotericin B when attached to the surface of biomaterials. These results suggest that hyphal formation is pivotal for biofilm development in C. albicans.

We tested the roles of these genes in several agar-based secretion assays and observed that the cho1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} and psd1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} psd2{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} strains manifested less protease and phospholipase activity. Since extracellular vesicles (EVs) are surrounded by a lipid membrane, we investigated the effects of these mutations on EV structure, composition, and biological activity. The cho1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} mutant releases EVs comparable in size to wild-type EVs, but EVs from the psd1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} psd2{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} strain are much larger than those from the wild type, including a population of {$>$}100-nm EVs not observed in the EVs from the wild type. Proteomic analysis revealed that EVs from both mutants had a significantly different protein cargo than that of EVs from the wild type. EVs were tested for their ability to activate NF-{$\kappa$}B in bone marrow-derived macrophage cells. While wild-type and psd1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} psd2{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} mutant-derived EVs activated NF-{$\kappa$}B, the cho1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} mutant-derived EV did not.

  abstract = {The Candida albicans plasma membrane plays important roles in interfacing with the environment, morphogenesis, and cell wall synthesis. The role of the Sur7 protein in cell wall structure and function was analyzed, since previous studies showed that this plasma membrane protein is needed to prevent abnormal intracellular growth of the cell wall. Sur7 localizes to stable patches in the plasma membrane, known as MCC (membrane compartment occupied by Can1), that are associated with eisosome proteins. The sur7{$\Delta$} mutant cells displayed increased sensitivity to factors that exacerbate cell wall defects, such as detergent (SDS) and the chitin-binding agents calcofluor white and Congo red. The sur7{$\Delta$} cells were also slightly more sensitive to inhibitors that block the synthesis of cell wall chitin (nikkomycin Z) and {$\beta$}-1,3-glucan (caspofungin). In contrast, Fmp45, a paralog of Sur7 that also localizes to punctate plasma membrane patches, did not have a detectable role in cell wall synthesis. Chemical analysis of cell wall composition demonstrated that sur7{$\Delta$} cells contain decreased levels of {$\beta$}-glucan, a glucose polymer that confers rigidity on the cell wall. Consistent with this, sur7{$\Delta$} cells were more sensitive to lysis, which could be partially rescued by increasing the osmolarity of the medium. Interestingly, Sur7 is present in static patches, whereas {$\beta$}-1,3-glucan synthase is mobile in the plasma membrane and is often associated with actin patches. Thus, Sur7 may influence {$\beta$}-glucan synthesis indirectly, perhaps by altering the functions of the cell signaling components that localize to the MCC and eisosome domains.},

Here, we describe extracellular vesicles carrying highly immunogenic {$\alpha$}-linked galactopyranosyl ({$\alpha$}-Gal) epitopes in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. P. brasiliensis is a dimorphic fungus that causes human paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). For vesicle preparations, cell-free supernatant fluids from yeast cells cultivated in Ham's defined medium-glucose were concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration system and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 \texttimes{} g. P. brasiliensis antigens were present in preparations from phylogenetically distinct isolates Pb18 and Pb3, as observed in immunoblots revealed with sera from PCM patients. In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), vesicle components containing {$\alpha$}-Gal epitopes reacted strongly with anti-{$\alpha$}-Gal antibodies isolated from both Chagas' disease and PCM patients, with Marasmius oreades agglutinin (MOA) (a lectin that recognizes terminal {$\alpha$}-Gal), but only faintly with natural anti-{$\alpha$}-Gal. Reactivity was inhibited after treatment with {$\alpha$}-galactosidase. Vesicle preparations analyzed by electron microscopy showed vesicular structures of 20 to 200 nm that were labeled both on the surface and in the lumen with MOA. In P. brasiliensis cells, components carrying {$\alpha$}-Gal epitopes were found distributed on the cell wall, following a punctuated confocal pattern, and inside large intracellular vacuoles. Lipid-free vesicle fractions reacted with anti-{$\alpha$}-Gal in ELISA only when not digested with {$\alpha$}-galactosidase, while reactivity with glycoproteins was reduced after {$\beta$}-elimination, which is indicative of partial O-linked chain localization. Our findings open new areas to explore in terms of host-parasite relationships in PCM and the role played in vivo by vesicle components and {$\alpha$}-galactosyl epitopes.},

We demonstrate that C. neoformans produces extracellular vesicles during in vitro growth and animal infection. Vesicular compartments, which are transferred to the extracellular space by cell wall passage, contain glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), a component of the cryptococcal capsule, and key lipids, such as glucosylceramide and sterols. A correlation between GXM-containing vesicles and capsule expression was observed. The results imply a novel mechanism for the release of the major virulence factor of C. neoformans whereby polysaccharide packaged in lipid vesicles crosses the cell wall and the capsule network to reach the extracellular environment.},

  abstract = {Cryptococcus neoformans produces vesicles containing its major virulence factor, the capsular polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan (GXM). These vesicles cross the cell wall to reach the extracellular space, where the polysaccharide is supposedly used for capsule growth or delivered into host tissues. In the present study, we characterized vesicle morphology and protein composition by a combination of techniques including electron microscopy, proteomics, enzymatic activity, and serological reactivity. Secretory vesicles in C. neoformans appear to be correlated with exosome-like compartments derived from multivesicular bodies. Extracellular vesicles manifested various sizes and morphologies, including electron-lucid membrane bodies and electron-dense vesicles. Seventy-six proteins were identified by proteomic analysis, including several related to virulence and protection against oxidative stress. Biochemical tests indicated laccase and urease activities in vesicles. In addition, different vesicle proteins were recognized by sera from patients with cryptococcosis. These results reveal an efficient and general mechanism of secretion of pathogenesis-related molecules in C. neoformans, suggesting that extracellular vesicles function as ``virulence bags'' that deliver a concentrated payload of fungal products to host effector cells and tissues.},

  abstract = {In Candida albicans, Myo5p and Sla2p are required for the polarized localization and function of cortical actin patches, for hyphal formation, and for endocytosis. Deletion of either the MYO5 or the SLA2 gene generated a common transcriptional response that involved changes in the transcript levels of cell wall protein- and membrane protein-encoding genes. However, these profiles were distinct from those observed for a mutant with specific deletions of the actin-organizing domains of Myo5p or for wild-type cells treated with cytochalasin A, both of which also generate defects in the organization of cortical actin patches. The profiles observed for the myo5{$\Delta$} and sla2{$\Delta$} mutants had similarities to those of wild-type cells subjected to an osmotic shock, and the defects in cortical patch function found with myo5{$\Delta$} and sla2{$\Delta$} mutants, but not cortical actin patch distribution per se, affected sensitivity to various stresses, including heat and osmotic shocks and cell wall damage. Secondary effects coupled with defective endocytosis, such as lack of polarized lipid rafts and associated protein Rvs167-GFP (where GFP is green fluorescent protein) and lack of polarized wall remodeling protein GFP-Gsc1, were also observed for the myo5{$\Delta$} and sla2{$\Delta$} mutants. The mitogen-activated protein kinases Hog1p and Mkc1p, which mediate signaling in response to osmotic stress and cell wall damage, do not play a major role in regulating the transcript level changes in the myo5{$\Delta$} and sla2{$\Delta$} mutants. Hog1p was not hyperphosphorylated in the myo5{$\Delta$} and sla2{$\Delta$} mutants, and the transcript levels of only a subset of genes affected in the myo5{$\Delta$} mutant were dependent upon the presence of Hog1p and Mkc1p. However, it appears that Hog1p and Mkc1p play important roles in the myo5{$\Delta$} mutant cells because double deletion of myosin I and either Hog1p or Mkc1p resulted in very-slow-growing cells.},

  abstract = {The cell wall of Candida albicans lies at the crossroads of pathogenicity and therapeutics. It contributes to pathogenicity through adherence and invasion; it is the target of both chemical and immunological antifungal strategies. We have initiated a dissection of cell wall function through targeted insertional mutagenesis of cell wall-related genes. Among 25 such genes, we were unable to generate homozygous mutations in 4, and they may be essential for viability. We created homozygous mutations in the remaining 21 genes. Insertion mutations in SUN41, Orf19.5412, Orf19.1277, MSB2, Orf19.3869, and WSC1 caused hypersensitivity to the cell wall inhibitor caspofungin, while two different ecm33 insertions caused mild caspofungin resistance. Insertion mutations in SUN41 and Orf19.5412 caused biofilm defects. Through analysis of homozygous sun41{$\Delta$}/sun41{$\Delta$} deletion mutants and sun41{$\Delta$}/sun41{$\Delta$}+pSUN41-complemented strains, we verified that Sun41 is required for biofilm formation and normal caspofungin tolerance. The sun41{$\Delta$}/sun41{$\Delta$} mutant had altered expression of four cell wall damage response genes, thus suggesting that it suffers a cell wall structural defect. Sun41 is required for inducing disease, because the mutant was severely attenuated in mouse models of disseminated and oropharyngeal candidiasis. Although the mutant produced aberrant hyphae, it had no defect in damaging endothelial or epithelial cells, unlike many other hypha-defective mutants. We suggest that the sun41{$\Delta$}/sun41{$\Delta$} cell wall defect is the primary cause of its attenuated virulence. As a small fungal surface protein with predicted glucosidase activity, Sun41 represents a promising therapeutic target.},

  abstract = {Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that causes systemic mycosis in immunosuppressed individuals. Recent studies have determined that this fungus produces vesicles that are released to the extracellular environment both in vivo and in vitro. These vesicles contain assorted cargo that includes several molecules associated with virulence and implicated in host-pathogen interactions, such as capsular polysaccharides, laccase, urease, and other proteins. To date, visualization of extracellular vesicles has relied on transmission electron microscopy, a time-consuming technique. In this work we report the use of fluorescent membrane tracers to stain lipophilic structures in cryptococcal culture supernatants and capsules. Two dialkylcarbocyanine probes with different spectral characteristics were used to visualize purified vesicles by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Dual staining of vesicles with dialkylcarbocyanine and RNA-selective nucleic acid dyes suggested that a fraction of the vesicle population carried RNA. Use of these dyes to stain whole cells, however, was hampered by their possible direct binding to capsular polysaccharide. A fluorescent phospholipid was used as additional membrane tracer to stain whole cells, revealing punctate structures on the edge of the capsule which are consistent with vesicular trafficking. Lipophilic dyes provide new tools for the study of fungal extracellular vesicles and their content. The finding of hydrophobic regions in the capsule of C. neoformans adds to the growing evidence for a structurally complex structure composed of polysaccharide and nonpolysaccharide components.},

Forty-seven amino acids from the C terminus of Hwp1p were sufficient to target GFP to the CW, and 66 amino acids from the C terminus of Ecm331p were sufficient to target GFP to the PM. Truncation and mutagenesis studies showed that G390 was the {$\omega$} cleavage site in Ecm331p. Domain exchange and mutagenesis studies showed that (i) the 5 amino acids immediately N-terminal to the {$\omega$} sites (the {$\omega$} - 5 to {$\omega$} - 1 amino acids) played key roles in targeting to the PM or CW; (ii) KK and FE residues at positions {$\omega$} - 1 and {$\omega$} - 2, respectively, targeted to the PM and CW; and (iii) a loss of I at position {$\omega$} - 5 increased PM retention. Small fluorescent reporters can be used to study the peptide signals that regulate PM versus CW targeting of GPI proteins and may be useful for identifying proteins that interact with key targeting signals.},

Overexpression of heterologous proteins at levels of up to 29\% of plasma membrane protein was achieved. Membrane proteins were expressed with or without green fluorescent protein (GFP), monomeric red fluorescent protein, His, FLAG/His, Cys, or His/Cys tags. Most GFP-tagged proteins tested were correctly trafficked within the cell, and His-tagged proteins could be affinity purified. Kinetic analysis of ABC transporters indicated that the apparent Km value and the Vmax value of ATPase activities were not significantly affected by the addition of His tags. The efflux properties of seven fungal drug pumps were characterized by their substrate specificities and their unique patterns of inhibition by eight xenobiotics that chemosensitized S. cerevisiae strains overexpressing ABC drug pumps to fluconazole. The modified hyperexpression system has wide application for the study of eukaryotic membrane proteins and could also be used in the pharmaceutical industry for drug screening.},

The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans can grow in a budding yeast or hyphal form. When it grows as hyphae, Mlc1 accumulates in a subapical spot suggestive of a Spitzenk{\"o}rper-like structure, while the polarisome components Spa2 and Bud6 localize to a surface crescent. Here we show that the vesicle-associated protein Sec4 also localizes to a spot, confirming that secretory vesicles accumulate in the putative C. albicans Spitzenk{\"o}rper. In contrast, exocyst components localize to a surface crescent. Using a combination of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) experiments and cytochalasin A to disrupt actin cables, we showed that Spitzenk{\"o}rper-located proteins are highly dynamic. In contrast, exocyst and polarisome components are stably located at the cell surface. It is thought that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae exocyst components are transported to the cell surface on secretory vesicles along actin cables. If each vesicle carried its own complement of exocyst components, then it would be expected that exocyst components would be as dynamic as Sec4 and would have the same pattern of localization. This is not what we observe in C. albicans. We propose a model in which a stream of vesicles arrives at the tip and accumulates in the Spitzenk{\"o}rper before onward delivery to the plasma membrane mediated by exocyst and polarisome components that are more stable residents of the cell surface.},

We demonstrate that C. albicans mutants lacking SUN41 show similar defects as found for S. cerevisiae, including defects in cytokinesis. In addition, the SUN41 mutant showed a higher sensitivity towards the cell wall-disturbing agent Congo red, whereas no difference was observed in the presence of calcofluor white. Compared to the wild type, SUN41 deletion strains exhibited a defect in biofilm formation, a reduced adherence on a Caco-2 cell monolayer, and were unable to form hyphae on solid medium under the conditions tested. Interestingly, Sun41p was found to be secreted in the medium of cells growing as blastospores as well as those forming hyphae. Our results support a function of SUN41p as a glycosidase involved in cytokinesis, cell wall biogenesis, adhesion to host tissue, and biofilm formation, indicating an important role in the host-pathogen interaction.},

In this report, we investigate the role of two previously uncharacterized Rho proteins, encoded by the Candida albicans RHO3 (CaRHO3) and CaCRL1/CaRHO4 genes. The CaRHO3 gene was found to contain one intron. Promoter shutdown experiments using a MET3 promoter-controlled RHO3 revealed a strong cell polarity defect and a partially depolarized actin cytoskeleton. Hyphal growth after promoter shutdown was abolished in rho3 mutants even in the presence of a constitutively active ras1(G13V) allele, and existing germ tubes became swollen. Deletion of C. albicans RHO4 indicated that it is a nonessential gene and that rho4 mutants were phenotypically different from rho3. Two distinct phenotypes of rho4 cells were elongated cell morphology and an unexpected cell separation defect generating chains of cells. Colony morphology of crl1/rho4 resulted in a growth-dependent smooth (long cell cycle length) or wrinkled (short cell cycle length) phenotype. This phenotype was additionally dependent on the rho4 cell separation defect and was also found in a Cacht3 chitinase mutant that shows a strong cytokinesis defect. The overexpression of the endoglucanase encoding the ENG1 gene, but not CHT3, suppressed the cell separation defect of crl1/rho4 but could not suppress the cell elongation phenotype. C. albicans Crl1/Rho4 and Bnr1 both localize to septal sites in yeast and hyphal cells but not to the hyphal tip. Deletion of RHO4 and BNR1 produced similar morphological phenotypes. Based on the localization of Rho4 and on the rho4 mutant phenotype, we propose a model in which Rho4p may function as a regulator of cell polarity, breaking the initial axis of polarity found during early bud growth to promote the construction of a septum.},

Current cell division models, which are based on cytological analyses of C. albicans, predict that hyphal branching is intimately linked with vacuolar inheritance in this fungus. Here we report the molecular validation of this model, showing that a specific mutation that disrupts vacuolar inheritance also affects hyphal division. The armadillo repeat-containing protein Vac8p plays an important role in vacuolar inheritance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The VAC8 gene was identified in the C. albicans genome sequence and was resequenced. Homozygous C. albicans vac8{$\Delta$} deletion mutants were generated, and their phenotypes were examined. Mutant vac8{$\Delta$} cells contained fragmented vacuoles, and minimal vacuolar material was inherited by daughter cells in hyphal or budding forms. Normal rates of growth and hyphal extension were observed for the mutant hyphae on solid serum-containing medium. However, branching frequencies were significantly increased in the mutant hyphae. These observations are consistent with a causal relationship between vacuolar inheritance and the cell division cycle in the subapical compartments of C. albicans hyphae. The data support the hypothesis that cytoplasmic volume, rather than cell size, is critical for progression through G1.},

In this study, we have investigated the secretion of tyrosol by C. albicans and explored its likely role in biofilm development. Both planktonic (suspended) cells and biofilms of four C. albicans strains, including three mutants with defined defects in the Efg 1 and Cph 1 morphogenetic signaling pathways, synthesized extracellular tyrosol during growth at 37\textdegree{}C. There was a correlation between tyrosol production and biomass for both cell types. However, biofilm cells secreted at least 50\% more tyrosol than did planktonic cells when tyrosol production was related to cell dry weight. The addition of exogenous farnesol to a wild-type strain inhibited biofilm formation by up to 33\% after 48 h. Exogenous tyrosol appeared to have no effect, but scanning electron microscopy revealed that tyrosol stimulated hypha production during the early stages (1 to 6 h) of biofilm development. Experiments involving the simultaneous addition of tyrosol and farnesol at different concentrations suggested that the action of farnesol was dominant, and 48-h biofilms formed in the presence of both compounds consisted almost entirely of yeast cells. When biofilm supernatants were tested for their abilities to inhibit or enhance germ tube formation by planktonic cells, the results indicated that tyrosol activity exceeds that of farnesol after 14 h, but not after 24 h, and that farnesol activity increases significantly during the later stages (48 to 72 h) of biofilm development. Overall, our results support the conclusion that tyrosol acts as a quorum-sensing molecule for biofilms as well as for planktonic cells and that its action is most significant during the early and intermediate stages of biofilm formation.},

C. albicans is the most frequent species, but considerable differences are found between the number of cases caused by C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. Studies from Northern Europe and the USA reported a high number of cases caused by C. glabrata, whereas studies from Spain and Brazil demonstrated a lower number of cases caused by C. glabrata and a higher number of cases attributed to C. parapsilosis. Globally, the frequency of C. albicans is decreasing, while that of C. glabrata and C. krusei is stable, and C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis are increasing. Patient characteristics and prior antifungal therapy also have a considerable influence on the distribution and frequency of Candida spp., regardless of the geographical area. C. albicans is more frequent in patients aged up to 18 years, the frequency of C. parapsilosis decreases with age, and C. glabrata is more common in the elderly. Finally, the presence of horizontal transmission of Candida spp. isolates (reported mainly in patients from the adult medical and post-surgical ICU, patients from oncology\textendash{}haematology units, and neonates) can affect species distribution.},

However, there are many unresolved issues regarding vesicle synthesis and stability, including the fact that vesicular packaging for extracellular factors involved in virulence must also have a mechanism for vesicle unloading. Consequently, we studied the kinetics of vesicle production and stability using [1-14C] palmitic acid metabolic labelling and dynamic light scattering techniques. Cryptococcus neoformans vesicles were produced throughout all stages of fungal culture growth and they were stable once isolated. Density gradient analysis revealed that only a portion of the vesicle population carried cryptococcal polysaccharide, implying heterogeneity in vesicular cargo. Vesicle incubation with macrophages resulted in rapid vesicle instability, a phenomenon that was ultimately associated with serum albumin. Additionally, albumin, along with mouse serum and murine immunoglobulin destabilized Bacillus anthracis vesicles, but the effect was not observed with ovalbumin or keyhole limpet haemocyanin, demonstrating that this phenomenon is neither host-, microbe- nor protein-specific. Our findings strongly suggest that cryptococcal vesicles are short-lived in vivo and vesicle destabilization is mediated by albumin. The ability of albumin to promote vesicular offload through destabilization indicates a new activity for this abundant serum protein.},

Previous studies have revealed the presence of EV in culture supernatants from fungal pathogens, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Sporothrix schenckii, Malassezia sympodialis and Candida albicans. Here we investigated the size, composition, kinetics of internalization by bone marrow-derived murine macrophages (MO) and dendritic cells (DC), and the immunomodulatory activity of C. albicans EV. We also evaluated the impact of EV on fungal virulence using the Galleria mellonella larvae model. By transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering, we identified two populations ranging from 50 to 100 nm and 350 to 850 nm. Two predominant seroreactive proteins (27 kDa and 37 kDa) and a group of polydispersed mannoproteins were observed in EV by immunoblotting analysis. Proteomic analysis of C. albicans EV revealed proteins related to pathogenesis, cell organization, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, response to stress, and several other functions. The major lipids detected by thin-layer chromatography were ergosterol, lanosterol and glucosylceramide. Short exposure of MO to EV resulted in internalization of these vesicles and production of nitric oxide, interleukin (IL)-12, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-{$\beta$}) and IL-10. Similarly, EV-treated DC produced IL-12p40, IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. In addition, EV treatment induced the up-regulation of CD86 and major histocompatibility complex class-II (MHC-II). Inoculation of G. mellonella larvae with EV followed by challenge with C. albicans reduced the number of recovered viable yeasts in comparison with infected larvae control. Taken together, our results demonstrate that C. albicans EV were immunologically active and could potentially interfere with the host responses in the setting of invasive candidiasis.},

In the present study, we examine whether the clinically important ascomycete Histoplasma capsulatum produce vesicles and utilized these structures to secrete macromolecules. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows transcellular secretion of vesicles by yeast cells. Proteomic and lipidomic analyses of vesicles isolated from culture supernatants reveal a rich collection of macromolecules involved in diverse processes, including metabolism, cell recycling, signalling and virulence. The results demonstrate that H. capsulatum can utilize a trans-cell wall vesicular transport secretory mechanism to promote virulence. Additionally, TEM of supernatants collected from Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Sporothrix schenckii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae documents that vesicles are similarly produced by additional ascomycetes. The vesicles from H. capsulatum react with immune serum from patients with histoplasmosis, providing an association of the vesicular products with pathogenesis. The findings support the proposal that vesicular secretion is a general mechanism in fungi for the transport of macromolecules related to virulence and that this process could be a target for novel therapeutics.},

To better understand the origin and evolution of reggie/flotillin structure and function, we searched databases for reggie/flotillin and SPFH-like proteins in organisms at the base and beyond the animal kingdom, and used the resulting dataset to compare their structural and functional domains. Our analysis shows that the SPFH grouping has little phylogenetic support, probably due to convergent evolution of its members. We also find that reggie/flotillin homologues are highly conserved among metazoans but are absent in plants, fungi and bacteria, where only proteins with `reggie-like' domains can be found. However, despite their low sequence similarities, reggie/flotillin and `reggie-like' domains appear to subserve related functions, suggesting that their basic biological role was acquired independently during evolution.},

Cryptococcal biofilm formation can complicate the placement of shunts used to relieve increased intracranial pressure in cryptococcal meningitis and can serve as a nidus for chronic infection. Biofilms are generally advantageous to pathogens in vivo, as they can confer resistance to antimicrobial compounds, including fluconazole and voriconazole in the case of C. neoformans. EDTA can inhibit biofilm formation by several microbes and enhances the susceptibility of biofilms to antifungal drugs. In this study, we evaluated the effect of sublethal concentrations of EDTA on the growth of cryptococcal biofilms. EDTA inhibited biofilm growth by C. neoformans, and the inhibition could be reversed by the addition of magnesium or calcium, implying that the inhibitory effect was by divalent cation starvation. EDTA also reduced the amount of the capsular polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan shed into the biofilm matrix and decreased vesicular secretion from the cell, thus providing a potential mechanism for the inhibitory effect of this cation-chelating compound. Our data imply that the growth of C. neoformans biofilms requires the presence of divalent metals in the growth medium and suggest that cations are required for the export of materials needed for biofilm formation, possibly including extracellular vesicles.},

The extent and characteristics of biofilm formation were then assessed microscopically and with a semiquantitative colorimetric technique based on the use of 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfo-phenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide. The results indicated that the effect of farnesol was dependent on the concentration of this compound and the initial adherence time, and preincubation with 300 {$\mu$}M farnesol completely inhibited biofilm formation. Supernatant media recovered from mature biofilms inhibited the ability of planktonic C. albicans to form filaments, indicating that a morphogenetic autoregulatory compound is produced in situ in biofilms. Northern blot analysis of RNA extracted from cells in biofilms indicated that the levels of expression of HWP1, encoding a hypha-specific wall protein, were decreased in farnesol-treated biofilms compared to the levels in controls. Our results indicate that farnesol acts as a naturally occurring quorum-sensing molecule which inhibits biofilm formation, and we discuss its potential for further development and use as a novel therapeutic agent.},

  abstract = {Simultaneously to phospholipid flip-flop that supports the procoagulant activity of activated platelets, blebs, supported by actin reorganization, are formed at the plasma membrane and generate microvesicles. The molecular mechanism of microvesicle shedding from activated platelets implicates Ca2+ influx and Ca2+-dependent protease, calpain. We previously demonstrated that the formation of lamellipodias and filopodias associated with platelet shape change involved the reorganization of actin filaments through a Cdc42/Rac1/p21-activated kinase (PAK)-dependent pathway. Here, we investigated whether platelet blebbing also depends on the Cdc42/Rac1/PAK pathway. Exposure of platelets in vitro to either a mixture of thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP) and collagen or the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 in the presence of Ca2+ generates microvesicles that can be identified by flow cytometry. The calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, diminished microvesicle formation induced by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, confirming the role of calpain in this process. PAK1/2 is cleaved in a calpain-dependent manner, and calpeptin prevents this cleavage and allows a transient activation of the kinase. Inhibition of Cdc42 and Rac1 by toxin B from Clostridium difficile, that suppresses PAK1/2 activation induced by TRAP and collagen or by A23187 in the presence of calpeptin, decreases polymerization of actin, lamellipodia and filopodia formation and interferes with the shedding of microvesicles. We conclude that the Rac1/Cdc42/PAK pathway controls actin reorganization that is necessary for microvesicle shedding.},

  abstract = {Exosomes are small membrane vesicles secreted by cells and enriched with plenty of proteins. Considering their significant roles in different physical activities and potential value for diagnostic drug delivery, researchers have put great efforts in in vitro tracking and content analysis of exosomes. Recently, the emergence of different kinds of super-resolution microscopy provides powerful tools for exosome study. Here, we demonstrate the application of single-molecule localization based super-resolution imaging technique in the imaging and tracking of cancer-derived exosomes. In the experiment, first, cancer-derived exosomes are extracted from the culture media of tumor cells. Then the exosome membrane receptors are labeled with photoswitchable probes, which allow super-resolution imaging of these membrane receptors via photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) or stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). By using human breast cancer cell-derived exosomes, we demonstrated simultaneous dual-color PALM/STORM imaging of two kinds of membrane receptors on the exosome membrane. Moreover, the successful labeling and imaging of exosomes make it possible to observe the interaction between cancer-derived exosomes and normal cells. Meanwhile, we realized the colocalization of cancer-derived exosomes and lysosomes in recipient cells with PALM/STORM imaging. Since exosomes play a vital role in intercellular communications, we anticipate that the presented PALM/STORM-based imaging and tracking of exosomes holds a great potential in the investigation of the mechanism of exosome-mediated cancer metastasis.},

  abstract = {Candida albicans frequently develops resistance to treatment with azole drugs due to the acquisition of gain-of-function mutations in the transcription factor Tac1p. Tac1p hyperactivation in azole-resistant isolates results in the constitutive overexpression of several genes, including CDR1 and CDR2, which encode two homologous transporters of the ATP-binding cassette family. Functional studies of Cdr1p and Cdr2p have been carried out so far by heterologous expression in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and by gene deletion or overexpression in azole-sensitive C. albicans strains in which CDR1 expression is low and CDR2 expression is undetectable. Thus, the direct demonstration that CDR1 and CDR2 overexpression causes azole resistance in clinical strains is still lacking, as is our knowledge of the relative contribution of each transporter to clinical azole resistance. In the present study, we used the SAT1 flipper system to delete the CDR1 and CDR2 genes from clinical isolate 5674. This strain is resistant to several azole derivatives due to a strong hyperactive mutation in Tac1p and expresses high levels of Cdr1p and Cdr2p. We found that deleting CDR1 had a major effect, reducing resistance to fluconazole (FLC), ketoconazole (KTC), and itraconazole (ITC) by 6-, 4-, and 8-fold, respectively. Deleting CDR2 had a much weaker effect, reducing FLC or KTC resistance by 1.5-fold, and had no effect on ITC resistance. These results demonstrate that Cdr1p is a major determinant of azole resistance in strain 5674 and potentially in other clinical strains overexpressing Cdr1p and Cdr2p, while Cdr2p plays a more minor role.},

  abstract = {An association between reduced susceptibility to echinocandins and changes in the 1,3-{$\beta$}-d-glucan synthase (GS) subunit Fks1p was investigated. Specific mutations in fks1 genes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans mutants are described that are necessary and sufficient for reduced susceptibility to the echinocandin drug caspofungin. One group of amino acid changes in ScFks1p, ScFks2p, and CaFks1p defines a conserved region (Phe 641 to Asp 648 of CaFks1p) in the Fks1 family of proteins. The relationship between several of these fks1 mutations and the phenotype of reduced caspofungin susceptibility was confirmed using site-directed mutagenesis or integrative transformation. Glucan synthase activity from these mutants was less susceptible to caspofungin inhibition, and heterozygous and homozygous Cafks1 C. albicans mutants could be distinguished based on the shape of inhibition curves. The C. albicans mutants were less susceptible to caspofungin than wild-type strains in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis. Five Candida isolates with reduced susceptibility to caspofungin were recovered from three patients enrolled in a clinical trial. Four C. albicans strains showed amino acid changes at Ser 645 of CaFks1p, while a single Candida krusei isolate had a deduced R1361G substitution. The clinical C. albicans mutants were less susceptible to caspofungin in the disseminated candidiasis model, and GS inhibition profiles and DNA sequence analyses were consistent with a homozygous fks1 mutation. Our results indicate that substitutions in the Fks1p subunit of GS are sufficient to confer reduced susceptibility to echinocandins in S. cerevisiae and the pathogens C. albicans and C. krusei.},

  abstract = {Candida albicans cells with increased cell wall chitin have reduced echinocandin susceptibility in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate whether C. albicans cells with elevated chitin levels have reduced echinocandin susceptibility in vivo. BALB/c mice were infected with C. albicans cells with normal chitin levels and compared to mice infected with high-chitin cells. Caspofungin therapy was initiated at 24 h postinfection. Mice infected with chitin-normal cells were successfully treated with caspofungin, as indicated by reduced kidney fungal burdens, reduced weight loss, and decreased C. albicans density in kidney lesions. In contrast, mice infected with high-chitin C. albicans cells were less susceptible to caspofungin, as they had higher kidney fungal burdens and greater weight loss during early infection. Cells recovered from mouse kidneys at 24 h postinfection with high-chitin cells had 1.6-fold higher chitin levels than cells from mice infected with chitin-normal cells and maintained a significantly reduced susceptibility to caspofungin when tested in vitro. At 48 h postinfection, caspofungin treatment induced a further increase in chitin content of C. albicans cells harvested from kidneys compared to saline treatment. Some of the recovered clones had acquired, at a low frequency, a point mutation in FKS1 resulting in a S645Y amino acid substitution, a mutation known to confer echinocandin resistance. This occurred even in cells that had not been exposed to caspofungin. Our results suggest that the efficacy of caspofungin against C. albicans was reduced in vivo due to either elevation of chitin levels in the cell wall or acquisition of FKS1 point mutations.},

  abstract = {Fluconazole (FLC) remains the antifungal drug of choice for non-life-threatening Candida infections, but drug-resistant strains have been isolated during long-term therapy with azoles. Drug efflux, mediated by plasma membrane transporters, is a major resistance mechanism, and clinically significant resistance in Candida albicans is accompanied by increased transcription of the genes CDR1 and CDR2, encoding plasma membrane ABC-type transporters Cdr1p and Cdr2p. The relative importance of each transporter protein for efflux-mediated resistance in C. albicans, however, is unknown; neither the relative amounts of each polypeptide in resistant isolates nor their contributions to efflux function have been determined. We have exploited the pump-specific properties of two antibody preparations, and specific pump inhibitors, to determine the relative expression and functions of Cdr1p and Cdr2p in 18 clinical C. albicans isolates. The antibodies and inhibitors were standardized using recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains that hyper-express either protein in a host strain with a reduced endogenous pump background. In all 18 C. albicans strains, including 13 strains with reduced FLC susceptibilities, Cdr1p was present in greater amounts (2- to 20-fold) than Cdr2p. Compounds that inhibited Cdr1p-mediated function, but had no effect on Cdr2p efflux activity, significantly decreased the resistance to FLC of seven representative C. albicans isolates, whereas three other compounds that inhibited both pumps did not cause increased chemosensitization of these strains to FLC. We conclude that Cdr1p expression makes a greater functional contribution than does Cdr2p to FLC resistance in C. albicans.},

  abstract = {Pneumocandins and echinocandins are fungicidal antibiotics, currently in clinical development, that inhibit 1,3-beta-D-glucan synthase (GS) in several human fungal pathogens. We have identified a gene from the diploid organism Candida albicans that encodes a target of these inhibitors. A 2.1-kb portion of this gene, designated CaFKS1, has significant homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae FKS1 and FKS2 genes, which encode partially functionally redundant subunits of GS. To evaluate the role of CaFkslp in susceptibility to echinocandins, we disrupted CaFKS1 on one homolog each of the spontaneous pneumocandin-resistant C. albicans mutants CAI4R1, NR2, NR3, and NR4. These mutants had been selected previously on agar plates containing the pneumocandin L-733,560. The clones derived from this transformation were either resistant (Ech[r]) or fully sensitive (Ech[s]) to inhibition by L-733,560 in both liquid broth microdilution and in vitro GS assays. The site of plasmid insertion in the transformants was mapped by Southern blot analysis, using restriction site polymorphisms in the CaFKS1 gene to distinguish between the two alleles (designated CaFKS1h and CaFKS1b). For strains CAI4R1 and NR2, the CaFKS1b allele was disrupted in each Ech(r) transformant; for strain NR4, CaFKS1h was disrupted in each Ech(r) transformant. We conclude that (i) strains CAI4R1, NR2, and NR4 are heterozygous for a dominant or semidominant pneumocandin resistance mutation at CaFKS1, (ii) drug resistance mutations can occur in either CaFKS1 allele, and (iii) CaFks1p is a target of the echinocandins. For transformants of strain NR3, all the clones we analyzed were uniformly Ech(r), and only the CaFKS1h allele, either in disrupted or wild-type form, was detected on genomic Southern blots. We believe gene conversion at the CaFKS1 locus may have produced two Cafks1h alleles that each contain an Ech(r) mutation. Transformants derived from the mutants were analyzed for susceptibility to pneumocandin treatment in a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis. Strains heterozygous for the resistant allele (i.e., C. albicans CAI4R1, NR2, and NR4) were moderately resistant to treatment, while strains without a functional Ech(s) allele (i.e., strain NR3 and derivatives of strain CAI4R1 with the disruption plasmid integrated in the Ech[s] allele) displayed strong in vivo echinocandin resistance. Finally, we were unable to inactivate both alleles at CaFKS1 by two-step integrative disruption, suggesting that CaFks1p is likely to be an essential protein in C. albicans.},

  abstract = {We investigated the cellular mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of miconazole-tolerant persisters in Candida albicans biofilms. Miconazole induced about 30\% killing of sessile C. albicans cells at 75 {$\mu$}M. The fraction of miconazole-tolerant persisters, i.e., cells that can survive high doses of miconazole (0.6 to 2.4 mM), in these biofilms was 1 to 2\%. Since miconazole induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in sessile C. albicans cells, we focused on a role for superoxide dismutases (Sods) in persistence and found the expression of Sod-encoding genes in sessile C. albicans cells induced by miconazole compared to the expression levels in untreated sessile C. albicans cells. Moreover, addition of the superoxide dismutase inhibitor N,N{${'}$}-diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) to C. albicans biofilms resulted in an 18-fold reduction of the miconazole-tolerant persister fraction and in increased endogenous ROS levels in these cells. Treatment of biofilms of C. albicans clinical isolates with DDC resulted in an 18-fold to more than 200-fold reduction of their miconazole-tolerant persister fraction. To further confirm the important role for Sods in C. albicans biofilm persistence, we used a {$\Delta$}sod4 {$\Delta$}sod5 mutant lacking Sods 4 and 5. Biofilms of the {$\Delta$}sod4 {$\Delta$}sod5 mutant contained at least 3-fold less of the miconazole-tolerant persisters and had increased ROS levels compared to biofilms of the isogenic wild type (WT). In conclusion, the occurrence of miconazole-tolerant persisters in C. albicans biofilms is linked to the ROS-detoxifying activity of Sods. Moreover, Sod inhibitors can be used to potentiate the activity of miconazole against C. albicans biofilms.},

  abstract = {We previously showed that phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] and septin regulation play major roles in maintaining Candida albicans cell wall integrity in response to caspofungin and other stressors. Here, we establish a link between PI(4,5)P2 signaling and septin localization and demonstrate that rapid redistribution of PI(4,5)P2 and septins is part of the natural response of C. albicans to caspofungin. First, we studied caspofungin-hypersusceptible C. albicans irs4 and inp51 mutants, which have elevated PI(4,5)P2 levels due to loss of PI(4,5)P2-specific 5{${'}$}-phosphatase activity. PI(4,5)P2 accumulated in discrete patches, rather than uniformly, along surfaces of mutants in yeast and filamentous morphologies, as visualized with a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-pleckstrin homology domain. The patches also contained chitin (calcofluor white staining) and cell wall protein Rbt5 (Rbt5-GFP). By transmission electron microscopy, patches corresponded to plasma membrane invaginations that incorporated cell wall material. Fluorescently tagged septins Cdc10 and Sep7 colocalized to these sites, consistent with well-described PI(4,5)P2-septin physical interactions. Based on expression patterns of cell wall damage response genes, irs4 and inp51 mutants were firmly positioned within a group of caspofungin-hypersusceptible, septin-regulatory protein kinase mutants. irs4 and inp51 were linked most closely to the gin4 mutant by expression profiling, PI(4,5)P2-septin-chitin redistribution and other phenotypes. Finally, sublethal 5-min exposure of wild-type C. albicans to caspofungin resulted in redistribution of PI(4,5)P2 and septins in a manner similar to those of irs4, inp51, and gin4 mutants. Taken together, our data suggest that the C. albicans Irs4-Inp51 5{${'}$}-phosphatase complex and Gin4 function upstream of PI(4,5)P2 and septins in a pathway that helps govern responses to caspofungin.},

  abstract = {Azole resistance in Candida albicans can be due to upregulation of multidrug transporters belonging to ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters (CDR1 and CDR2) or major facilitators (CaMDR1). Upregulation of these genes can also be achieved by exposure to fluphenazine, resulting in specific upregulation of CDR1 and CDR2 and by exposure to benomyl, resulting in specific CaMDR1 upregulation. In this study, these two different states of gene upregulation were used to determine coregulated genes that often share similar functions or similar regulatory regions. The transcript profiles of a laboratory strain exposed to these drugs were therefore determined and compared with those of two matched pairs of azole-susceptible and -resistant strains expressing CDR1 and CDR2 (CDR strains) or CaMDR1 (MDR isolates). The results obtained revealed that, among 42 commonly regulated genes (8.6\% of all regulated genes) between fluphenazine-exposed cells and CDR isolates, the most upregulated were CDR1 and CDR2 as expected, but also IFU5, RTA3 (which encodes putative membrane proteins), HSP12 (which encodes heat shock protein), and IPF4065 (which is potentially involved in stress response). Interestingly, all but HSP12 and IPF4065 contain a putative cis-acting drug responsive element in their promoters. Among the 57 genes (11.5\% of all regulated genes) commonly regulated between benomyl-exposed cells and MDR isolates, the most upregulated were CaMDR1 as expected but also genes with oxido-reductive functions such as IFD genes, IPF5987, GRP2 (all belonging to the aldo-keto reductase family), IPF7817 [NAD(P)H oxido-reductase], and IPF17186. Taken together, these results show that in vitro drug-induced gene expression only partially mimics expression profiles observed in azole-resistant clinical strains. Upregulated genes in both drug-exposed conditions and clinical strains are drug resistance genes but also genes that could be activated under cell damage conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived exosomes exhibit protective effects on damaged or diseased tissues. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1{$\alpha$} (HIF-1{$\alpha$}) plays a critical role in bone development. However, HIF-1{$\alpha$} is easily biodegradable under normoxic conditions. The bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were transfected with adenovirus carrying triple point-mutations (amino acids 402, 564, and 803) in the HIF-1{$\alpha$} coding sequence (CDS). The mutant HIF-1{$\alpha$} can efficiently express functional proteins under normoxic conditions. To date, no study has reported the role of exosomes secreted by mutant HIF-1{$\alpha$} modified BMSCs in the recovery of the early steroid-induced avascular necrosis of femoral head (SANFH). In this study, we firstly analyzed exosomes derived from BMSCs modified by mutant (BMSC-ExosMU) or wild-type HIF-1{$\alpha$} (BMSC-ExosWT). In vitro, we investigated the osteogenic differentiation capacity of BMSCs modified by BMSC-ExosMU or BMSC-ExosWT, and the angiogenesis effects of BMSC-ExosMU and BMSC-ExosWT on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Besides, the healing of the femoral head was also assessed in vivo. We found that the potential of osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs treated with BMSC-ExosMU was higher than the wild-type group in vitro. In addition, BMSC-ExosMU stimulated the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with the BMSC-ExosWT or PBS control group, the injection of BMSC-ExosMU into the necrosis region markedly accelerated the bone regeneration and angiogenesis, which were indicated by the increased trabecular reconstruction and microvascular density. Taken together, our data suggest that BMSC-ExosMU facilitates the repair of SANFH by enhancing osteogenesis and angiogenesis.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the risk factors, clinical manifestations, and outcome of candidemia in immunocompromised (IC) and nonimmunocompromised (NIC) critically ill patients. Data were collected prospectively over a 2-year period (02/2000\textendash{}01/2002) from patients in a 25-bed, medical\textendash{}surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Eligible for participation in this study were patients who developed candidemia during their ICU stay. Patients under antifungal therapy and with a confirmed systemic fungal infection prior to the diagnosis of candidemia were excluded. Cultures of blood, urine, and stool were performed for all patients in the study, and all patients underwent endoscopy/biopsy of the esophagus for detection of Candida. Smears and/or scrapings of oropharyngeal and esophageal lesions were examined for hyphae and/or pseudohyphae and were also cultured for yeasts. During the study period, 1,627 patients were hospitalized in the ICU, 57\% for primary medical reasons and 43\% for surgical reasons. After application of the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria, 24 patients with candidemia (9 IC and 15 NIC) were analyzed. Total parenteral nutrition was more common in IC than in NIC patients (9/9 [100\%] vs 8/15 [53\%], p = 0.02). Oropharyngeal candidiasis was detected in 5 of 9 (55.5\%) IC patients and in 1 of 15 (6.5\%) NIC patients (p = 0.015). Esophageal candidiasis was also more common in IC than in NIC patients (4/9 [44\%] vs 0/15 [0\%], p = 0.012). Among the 9 IC patients, all except 2 died, resulting in a crude mortality of 78\%; among the 15 NIC patients, 9 died, resulting in a crude mortality of 60\% (p {$>$} 0.05). Autopsy was performed in two IC and in six NIC patients, with disseminated candidiasis found in one IC patient. Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis are frequent in IC patients with candidemia. In contrast, this coexistence is rare in NIC critically ill patients with Candida bloodstream infections. A high mortality was noted in both IC and NIC critically ill patients with candidemia.},

This study deals with the performance evaluation for the detection and characterisation of various particles by NTA. Our investigation focusses on the NTA measurement parameter set-ups, as will be shown in this study, are very crucial parameters to correctly analyse and interpret the data. In order to achieve this, we used (i) polystyrene standard particles as well as (ii) protein particles. We show the highly precise and reproducible detection of particle size and concentration in monodisperse polystyrene particle systems, under specified and constant parameter settings. On the other hand, our results exemplify potential risks and errors while setting inadequate parameters with regards to the results and thus interpretation thereof. In particular changes of the parameters, camera level (CL) and detection threshold (DT), led to significant changes in the determined particle concentration. We propose defined and specified ``optimal'' camera levels for monodisperse particle suspension characterisations in the size range of 20\textendash{}1000nm. We illustrate that the results of polydisperse polystyrene standard particle solution measurements, highly depend on the used parameter settings, which are rarely published with the data. Changes in these settings led to the ``appearance'' or ``disappearance'' of particle populations (''peaks'') for polydisperse systems. Thus, a correct evaluation of the particle size populations in the sample becomes very challenging. For the use of NTA in biopharmaceutical analysis, proteinaceous samples were investigated. We analysed protein particle suspensions and compared unstressed and stressed (formation of aggregates) protein samples similar to polystyrene particle analysis. We also studied these samples in two different measuring modes (general capture mode and live monitoring mode) that the commercially available analysis software is offering. Our results stated the live monitoring mode as more suitable for protein samples, as the results were more reproducible and less operator-depending. In conclusion, NTA is a potential technique and unique in quantitative evaluation of particle suspensions in the subvisible size range, especially for monodisperse suspensions. We strongly urge on not underestimating the influence of the measuring parameters on the obtained results, which should be presented with the data in order to better judge and interpret the NTA results.},

To become extracellular, these vesicles not only must be released from the plasma membrane but also must pass through the dense matrix of the cell wall. The greatest unknown in the area of fungal vesicles is the mechanism by which these vesicles are released to the extracellular space given the presence of the fungal cell wall. Here we used electron microscopy techniques to image the interactions of vesicles with the cell wall. Our goal was to define the ultrastructural morphology of the process to gain insights into the mechanisms involved. We describe single and multiple vesicle-leaving events, which we hypothesized were due to plasma membrane and multivesicular body vesicle origins, respectively. We further utilized melanized cells to ``trap'' vesicles and visualize those passing through the cell wall. Vesicle size differed depending on whether vesicles left the cytoplasm in single versus multiple release events. Furthermore, we analyzed different vesicle populations for vesicle dimensions and protein composition. Proteomic analysis tripled the number of proteins known to be associated with vesicles. Despite separation of vesicles into batches differing in size, we did not identify major differences in protein composition. In summary, our results indicate that vesicles are generated by more than one mechanism, that vesicles exit the cell by traversing the cell wall, and that vesicle populations exist as a continuum with regard to size and protein composition.},

  volume = {19},
  issn = {0960-9822},
  abstract = {Summary
Background
Increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, small GTPase activation, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and the directed targeting of proteases to sites of extracellular matrix degradation all accompany the process of tumor cell invasion. Several studies have implicated the small GTP-binding protein ARF6 in tumor cell invasion, although the molecular basis by which ARF6 facilitates this process is unclear.
Results
We show that the ARF6 GTP/GDP cycle regulates the release of protease-loaded plasma membrane-derived microvesicles from tumor cells into the surrounding environment. To~enable microvesicle shedding, ARF6-GTP-dependent activation of phospholipase D promotes the recruitment of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) to the plasma membrane where, in turn, ERK phosphorylates and activates myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). MLCK-mediated MLC phosphorylation is required for microvesicle release. Inhibition of ARF6 activation is accompanied by PKC-mediated phosphorylation of MLC, which blocks microvesicle shedding. Protein cargo appears to be selectively sorted into microvesicles, and adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) is facilitated by microvesicle-associated integrin receptors.
Conclusions
Microvesicle shedding in tumor cells occurs via an actomyosin-based membrane abscission mechanism that is regulated by nucleotide cycling on ARF6. Microvesicle shedding appears to release selected cellular components, particularly those involved in cell adhesion and motility, into the surrounding environment. These findings suggest that ARF6 activation and the proteolytic activities of microvesicles, both of which are thought to correlate directly with tumor progression, could potentially serve as biomarkers for disease.},

The vesicles are heterogeneous and morphologically similar to mammalian exosomes, with intact bilayered membranes. Proteomic analyses reveal that the vesicles contain a broad array of macromolecules, many of which are associated with fungal virulence. Further, the biological import of the extracellular fungal vesicles is supported by their presence during murine cryptococcosis and the immunoreactivity of convalescent serum from patients with C. neoformans or H. capsulatum vesicle protein extracts.In contrast to most eukaryotic cells, fungi have complex cell walls, that could in theory provide a significant barrier to the secretion of large molecules. The discovery of trans-cell wall vesicular transport in fungi provides a solution to the problem of extracellular transport of macromolecules. Identifying similar vesicles in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes suggest that the shuttle system is ancient, predating the divergence of these branches 0.5-1.0 billion years ago. Importantly, the discovery of this trans-cell wall vesicular transport system also poses new, interesting questions for future investigations.},

  abstract = {Invasive candidiasis (IC) is a leading cause of mycosis-associated mortality in the United States. We examined data from the National Center for Health Statistics and reviewed recent literature in order to update the epidemiology of IC. IC-associated mortality has remained stable, at approximately 0.4 deaths per 100,000 population, since 1997, while mortality associated with invasive aspergillosis has continued to decline. Candida albicans remains the predominant cause of IC, accounting for over half of all cases, but Candida glabrata has emerged as the second most common cause of IC in the United States, and several less common Candida species may be emerging, some of which can exhibit resistance to triazoles and/or amphotericin B. Crude and attributable rates of mortality due to IC remain unacceptably high and unchanged for the past 2 decades. Nonpharmacologic preventive strategies should be emphasized, including hand hygiene; appropriate use, placement, and care of central venous catheters; and prudent use of antimicrobial therapy. Given that delays in appropriate antifungal therapy are associated with increased mortality, improved use of early empirical, preemptive, and prophylactic therapies should also help reduce IC-associated mortality. Several studies have now identified important variables that can be used to predict risk of IC and to help guide preventive strategies such as antifungal prophylaxis and early empirical therapy. However, improved non-culture-based diagnostics are needed to expand the potential for preemptive (or early directed) therapy. Further research to improve diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic strategies is necessary to reduce the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with IC.},

  abstract = {Summary
Prion and prion-like domains (PLDs) are found in many proteins throughout the animal kingdom. We found that the PLD in the S.~cerevisiae exomer-dependent cargo protein Pin2 is involved in the regulation of protein transport and localization. The domain serves as a Pin2 retention signal in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Pin2 is localized in a polarized fashion at the plasma membrane of the bud early in the cell cycle and the bud neck at cytokinesis. This polarized localization is dependent on both exo- and endocytosis. Upon environmental stress, Pin2 is rapidly endocytosed, and the PLD aggregates and causes sequestration of Pin2. The aggregation of Pin2 is reversible upon stress removal and Pin2 is rapidly re-exported to the plasma membrane. Altogether, these data uncover a role for PLDs as protein localization elements.},

  abstract = {Males of advanced age represent a rapidly growing population at risk for prostate cancer. In the contemporary setting of earlier detection, a majority of prostate carcinomas are still clinically localized and often treated using radiation therapy. Our recent studies have shown that premature cellular senescence, rather than apoptosis, accounts for most of the clonogenic death induced by clinically relevant doses of irradiation in prostate cancer cells. We show here that this treatment-induced senescence was associated with a significantly increased release of exosome-like microvesicles. In premature senescence, this novel secretory phenotype was dependent on the activation of p53. In addition, the release of exosome-like microvesicles also increased during proliferative senescence in normal human diploid fibroblasts. These data support the hypothesis that senescence, initiated either by telomere attrition (e.g., aging) or DNA damage (e.g., radiotherapy), may induce a p53-dependent increase in the biogenesis of exosome-like vesicles. Ultrastructural analysis and RNA interference\textendash{}mediated knockdown of Tsg101 provided significant evidence that the additional exosomes released by prematurely senescent prostate cancer cells were principally derived from multivesicular endosomes. Moreover, these exosomes were enriched in B7-H3 protein, a recently identified diagnostic marker for prostate cancer, and an abundance of what has recently been termed ``exosomal shuttle RNA.'' Our findings are consistent with the proposal that exosomes can transfer cargos, with both immunoregulatory potential and genetic information, between cells through a novel mechanism that may be recruited to increase exosome release during accelerated and replicative cellular senescence.

Because several genes coding for ABC proteins exist in the genome of C. albicans, but only Cdr1p and Cdr2p have established roles in MDR, it is implicit that the other members of the ABC family also have alternative physiological roles. The present study focuses on an ABC transporter of C. albicans, Mlt1p, which is localized in the vacuolar membrane and specifically transports PC (phosphatidylcholine) into the vacuolar lumen. Transcriptional profiling of the mlt1{$\increment$}/{$\increment$} mutant revealed a down-regulation of the genes involved in endocytosis, oxidoreductase activity, virulence and hyphal development. High-throughput MS-based lipidome analysis revealed that the Mlt1p levels affect lipid homoeostasis and thus lead to a plethora of physiological perturbations. These include a delay in endocytosis, inefficient sequestering of reactive oxygen species (ROS), defects in hyphal development and attenuated virulence. The present study is an emerging example where new and unconventional roles of an ABC transporter are being identified.},

The human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, can grow in a budded yeast form or in a highly polarized hyphal form, and thus provides a model to study this phenomenon. During hyphal, but not yeast growth, secretory vesicles accumulate in an apical body called a Spitzenk{\"o}rper, which acts to focus delivery of the vesicles to the tip. Post-Golgi transport of secretory vesicles is mediated by the Rab GTPase Sec4, activated by its GEF Sec2. Using a combination of deletion mapping, in vitro mutagenesis, an analogue-sensitive allele of Cdc28 and an in vitro kinase assay, we show that localization of Sec2 to the Spitzenk{\"o}rper and normal hyphal development requires phosphorylation of Serine 584 by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28.

This finding was further supported by gene expression analysis of the yck2{$\Delta$}/yck2{$\Delta$} strain which showed significant upregulation of UME6, a key transcriptional regulator of hyphal transition and biofilm formation, and cell wall protein genes ALS3, HWP1, and SUN41, all of which are associated with morphogenesis and biofilm architecture.

Absence of CaYck2p also affected fungal-host interaction; the yck2{$\Delta$}/yck2{$\Delta$} strain had significantly reduced ability to damage host cells. However, the yck2{$\Delta$}/yck2{$\Delta$} strain had wild-type susceptibility to cyclosporine and FK506, suggesting that CaYck2p functions independently from the Ca+/calcineurin pathway.

Analysis of Ca-Sur7 showed that this four transmembrane domain protein localized to stable punctate patches, similar to the plasma membrane subdomains known as eisosomes or MCC that were discovered in S. cerevisiae. The localization of Ca-Sur7 depended on sphingolipid synthesis. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, a C. albicans sur7{$\Delta$} mutant displayed defects in endocytosis and morphogenesis. Septins and actin were mislocalized, and cell wall synthesis was very abnormal, including long projections of cell wall into the cytoplasm. Several phenotypes of the sur7{$\Delta$} mutant are similar to the effects of inhibiting {$\beta$}-glucan synthase, suggesting that the abnormal cell wall synthesis is related to activation of chitin synthase activity seen under stress conditions. These results expand the roles of eisosomes by demonstrating that Sur7 is needed for proper plasma membrane organization and cell wall synthesis. A conserved Cys motif in the first extracellular loop of fungal Sur7 proteins is similar to a characteristic motif of the claudin proteins that form tight junctions in animal cells, suggesting a common role for these tetraspanning membrane proteins in forming specialized plasma membrane domains.},

  abstract = {The sugar N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) plays an important role in nutrient sensing and cellular regulation in a wide range of organisms from bacteria to humans. In the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, GlcNAc induces a morphological transition from budding to hyphal growth. Proteomic comparison of plasma membrane proteins from buds and from hyphae induced by GlcNAc identified a novel hyphal protein (Ngt1) with similarity to the major facilitator superfamily of transporters. An Ngt1-GFP fusion was detected in the plasma membrane after induction with GlcNAc, but not other related sugars. Ngt1-GFP was also induced by macrophage phagocytosis, suggesting a role for the GlcNAc response in signaling entry into phagolysosomes. NGT1 is needed for efficient GlcNAc uptake and for the ability to induce hyphae at low GlcNAc concentrations. High concentrations of GlcNAc could bypass the need for NGT1 to induce hyphae, indicating that elevated intracellular levels of GlcNAc induce hyphal formation. Expression of NGT1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae promoted GlcNAc uptake, indicating that Ngt1 acts directly as a GlcNAc transporter. Transport mediated by Ngt1 was specific, as other sugars could not compete for the uptake of GlcNAc. Thus, Ngt1 represents the first eukaryotic GlcNAc transporter to be discovered. The presence of NGT1 homologues in the genome sequences of a wide range of eukaryotes from yeast to mammals suggests that they may also function in the cellular processes regulated by GlcNAc, including those that underlie important diseases such as cancer and diabetes.},

  abstract = {Cell polarity is essential for many cellular functions including division and cell-fate determination. Although RhoGTPase signaling and vesicle trafficking are both required for the establishment of cell polarity, the mechanisms by which they are coordinated are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the yeast RhoGAP (GTPase activating protein), Bem3, is targeted to sites of polarized growth by the endocytic and recycling pathways. Specifically, deletion of SLA2 or RCY1 led to mislocalization of Bem3 to depolarized puncta and accumulation in intracellular compartments, respectively. Bem3 partitioned between the plasma membrane and an intracellular membrane-bound compartment. These Bem3-positive structures were polarized towards sites of bud emergence and were mostly observed during the pre-mitotic phase of apical growth. Cell biological and biochemical approaches demonstrated that this intracellular Bem3 compartment contained markers for both the endocytic and secretory pathways, which were reminiscent of the Spitzenko\textasciidieresis{}rper present in the hyphal tips of growing fungi. Importantly, Bem3 was not a passive cargo, but recruited the secretory Rab protein, Sec4, to the Bem3-containing compartments. Moreover, Bem3 deletion resulted in less efficient localization of Sec4 to bud tips during early stages of bud emergence. Surprisingly, these effects of Bem3 on Sec4 were independent of its GAP activity, but depended on its ability to efficiently bind endomembranes. This work unveils unsuspected and important details of the relationship between vesicle traffic and elements of the cell polarity machinery: (1) Bem3, a cell polarity and peripherally associated membrane protein, relies on vesicle trafficking to maintain its proper localization; and (2) in turn, Bem3 influences secretory vesicle trafficking.},

A large number of studies of diverse organisms from yeast to humans indicate that the conserved, small-molecular-weight GTPases function as key signaling proteins involved in cell polarization. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a particularly attractive model because it displays pronounced cell polarity in response to intracellular and extracellular cues. Cells of S. cerevisiae undergo polarized growth during various phases of their life cycle, such as during vegetative growth, mating between haploid cells of opposite mating types, and filamentous growth upon deprivation of nutrition such as nitrogen. Substantial progress has been made in deciphering the molecular basis of cell polarity in budding yeast. In particular, it becomes increasingly clear how small GTPases regulate polarized cytoskeletal organization, cell wall assembly, and exocytosis at the molecular level and how these GTPases are regulated. In this review, we discuss the key signaling pathways that regulate cell polarization during the mitotic cell cycle and during mating.},

  abstract = {Fluconazole is a commonly used antifungal drug that inhibits Erg11, a protein responsible for 14{$\alpha$}-demethylation during ergosterol synthesis. Consequently, ergosterol is depleted from cellular membranes and replaced by toxic 14{$\alpha$}-methylated sterols, which causes increased membrane fluidity and drug permeability. Surface-grown and planktonic cultures of Candida albicans responded similarly to fluconazole at 0.5 mg/liter, showing reduced biomass formation, severely reduced ergosterol levels, and almost complete inhibition of hyphal growth. There was no evidence of cell leakage. Mass spectrometric analysis of the secretome showed that its composition was strongly affected and included 17 fluconazole-specific secretory proteins. Relative quantification of 14N-labeled query walls relative to a reference standard mixture of 15N-labeled yeast and hyphal walls in combination with immunological analysis revealed considerable fluconazole-induced changes in the wall proteome as well. They were, however, similar for both surface-grown and planktonic cultures. Two major trends emerged: (i) decreased incorporation of hypha-associated wall proteins (Als3, Hwp1, and Plb5), consistent with inhibition of hyphal growth, and (ii) increased incorporation of putative wall repair-related proteins (Crh11, Pga4, Phr1, Phr2, Pir1, and Sap9). As exposure to the wall-perturbing drug Congo red led to a similar response, these observations suggested that fluconazole affects the wall. In keeping with this, the resistance of fluconazole-treated cells to wall-perturbing compounds decreased. We propose that fluconazole affects the integrity of both the cellular membranes and the fungal wall and discuss its potential consequences for antifungal therapy. We also present candidate proteins from the secretome for clinical marker development.},

  abstract = {The ability of Candida albicans to switch from yeast to hyphal growth is essential for its virulence. The walls and especially the covalently attached wall proteins are involved in the primary host\textendash{}pathogen interactions. Three hyphal induction methods were compared, based on fetal calf serum, the amino sugar N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and the mammalian cell culture medium Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM). GlcNAc and IMDM were preferred, allowing stable hyphal growth over a prolonged period without significant reversion to yeast growth and with high biomass yields. We employed Fourier transform-MS combined with a 15N-metabolically labelled reference culture as internal standard for relative quantification of changes in the wall proteome upon hyphal induction. A total of 21 wall proteins were quantified. Our induction methods triggered a similar response characterized by (i) a category of wall proteins showing strongly increased incorporation levels (Als3, Hwp2, Hyr1, Plb5 and Sod5), (ii) another category with strongly decreased levels (Rhd3, Sod4 and Ywp1) and (iii) a third one enriched for carbohydrate-active enzymes (including Cht2, Crh11, Mp65, Pga4, Phr1, Phr2 and Utr2) and showing only a limited response.

Analyses of different chimeras revealed that nuclear accumulation of C. albicans Rac1 requires the NLS-motifs at its carboxyl-terminus, which are blocked by prenylation of the adjacent cysteine residue. Furthermore, we show that C. albicans Rac1 dynamics, both at the plasma membrane and in the nucleus, are dependent on its activation state and in particular that the inactive form accumulates faster in the nucleus. Heterologous expression of human Rac1 in C. albicans also results in nuclear accumulation, yet accumulation is more rapid than that of C. albicans Rac1. Taken together our results indicate that Rac1 nuclear accumulation is an inherent property of this G-protein and suggest that the requirements for its nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling are conserved from fungi to humans.},

Notably, 98 proteins were common to both samples, and the groups most represented were metabolic and cell wall-related proteins. The results of this study showed that RML2U had an altered pattern of proteins secreted by the classical secretion pathway as well as the formation of extracellular vesicles, including their size, quantity, and protein composition. Specifically, the secretion of aspartic protease 2 (Sap2) was compromised but not its intracellular expression, with bovine serum albumin (BSA) degradation by RML2U being altered when BSA was used as the sole nitrogen source. Furthermore, as recent research links the expression of Sap2 to the TOR (Target Of Rapamycin) signaling pathway, the sensitivity of RML2U to rapamycin (the inhibitor of TOR kinase) was tested and found to be enhanced, connecting Ecm33 with this pathway.},

  abstract = {The pathogenic fungus Candida albicans secretes a considerable number of hydrolases and other proteins. In-depth studies of the C. albicans secretome could thus provide new candidates for diagnostic markers and vaccine development. We compared various growth conditions differing in pH, temperature and the presence of the hyphal inducer N-acetylglucosamine. The polypeptide content of the growth media was ca. 0.1\textendash{}0.2\% of the total biomass. Using LC\textendash{}tandem mass spectrometry, we identified 44 secretory proteins, the transmembrane protein Msb2, six secretory pathway-associated proteins and 28 predicted cytosolic proteins. Many secretory proteins are wall-related, suggesting that their presence in the growth medium is at least partially due to accidental release from the walls. Als3, Csa2, Rbt4, Sap4 and Sap6 were enriched in the medium of hyphal cultures; Bgl2, Cht3, Dag7, Eng1, Pir1, Rbe1, Scw11, Sim1/Sun42, Xog1 and Ywp1 in the medium of yeast cells; and Plb4.5 in pH 4 medium. Seven proteins (Cht3, Mp65, Orf19.5063/Coi1, Scw11, Sim1, Sun41 and Tos1) were consistently present under all conditions tested. These observations indicate that C. albicans tightly regulates its secretome. Mp65, Sun41, and Tos1 were each predicted to contain at least one highly immunogenic peptide. In total, we identified 29 highly immunogenic peptides originating from 18 proteins, including two members of the family of secreted aspartyl proteases. Fifty-six peptides were identified as proteotypic and will be useful for quantification purposes. In summary, the number of identified secretory proteins in the growth medium has been substantially extended, and growth conditions strongly affect the composition of the secretome.

On the basis of the screening of sera from candidemia and three groups of noncandidemia patients, a core set of 19 immunodominant antibodies against secreted proteins of C. albicans was identified, seven of which represent potential diagnostic markers for candidemia (Xog1, Lip4, Asc1, Met6, Tsa1, Tpi1, and Prx1). Intriguingly, some secreted, strongly glycosylated protein antigens showed high cross-reactivity with sera from noncandidemia control groups. Enzymatic deglycosylation of proteins secreted from hyphae significantly impaired sera antibody recognition.

  abstract = {SWI/SNF is an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex that is required for the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. While most of the fungal SWI/SNF components are evolutionarily conserved with those of the metazoan SWI/SNF, subunits such as Snf6 are specific to certain fungi and thus represent potential antifungal targets. We have characterized the role of the Snf6 protein in Candida albicans. Our data showed that although there was low conservation of its protein sequence with other fungal orthologs, Snf6 was copurified with bona fide SWI/SNF complex subunits. The role of Snf6 in C. albicans was investigated by determining its genome-wide occupancy using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to tiling arrays in addition to transcriptional profiling of the snf6 conditional mutant. Snf6 directs targets that were enriched in functions related to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolic circuits, to cellular transport, and to heat stress responses. Under hypha-promoting conditions, Snf6 expanded its set of targets to include promoters of genes related to respiration, ribosome biogenesis, mating, and vesicle transport. In accordance with the genomic occupancy data, an snf6 doxycycline-repressible mutant exhibited growth defects in response to heat stress and also when grown in the presence of different fermentable and nonfermentable carbon sources. Snf6 was also required to differentiate invasive hyphae in response to different cues. This study represents the first comprehensive characterization, at the genomic level, of the role of SWI/SNF in the pathogenic yeast C. albicans and uncovers functions that are essential for fungal morphogenesis and metabolic flexibility.
IMPORTANCE Candida albicans is a natural component of the human microbiota but also an opportunistic pathogen that causes life-threatening infections in immunosuppressed patients. Current therapeutics include a limited number of molecules that suffer from limitations, including growing clinical resistance and toxicity. New molecules are being clinically investigated; however, the majority of these potential antifungals target the same processes as do the standard antifungals and might confront the same problems of toxicity and loss of efficiency due to the common resistance mechanisms. Here, we characterized the role of Snf6, a fungus-specific subunit of the chromatin-remodeling complex SWI/SNF. Our genomic and phenotypic data demonstrated a central role of Snf6 in biological processes that are critical for a fungal pathogen to colonize its host and cause disease, suggesting Snf6 as a possible antifungal target.},

  abstract = {In vivo transcriptional analyses of microbial pathogens are often hampered by low proportions of pathogen biomass in host organs, hindering the coverage of full pathogen transcriptome. We aimed to address the transcriptome profiles of Candida albicans, the most prevalent fungal pathogen in systemically infected immunocompromised patients, during systemic infection in different hosts. We developed a strategy for high-resolution quantitative analysis of the C. albicans transcriptome directly from early and late stages of systemic infection in two different host models, mouse and the insect Galleria mellonella. Our results show that transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries were enriched for fungal transcripts up to 1,600-fold using biotinylated bait probes to capture C. albicans sequences. This enrichment biased the read counts of only \textasciitilde{}3\% of the genes, which can be identified and removed based on a priori criteria. This allowed an unprecedented resolution of C. albicans transcriptome in vivo, with detection of over 86\% of its genes. The transcriptional response of the fungus was surprisingly similar during infection of the two hosts and at the two time points, although some host- and time point-specific genes could be identified. Genes that were highly induced during infection were involved, for instance, in stress response, adhesion, iron acquisition, and biofilm formation. Of the in vivo-regulated genes, 10\% are still of unknown function, and their future study will be of great interest. The fungal RNA enrichment procedure used here will help a better characterization of the C. albicans response in infected hosts and may be applied to other microbial pathogens.
IMPORTANCE Understanding the mechanisms utilized by pathogens to infect and cause disease in their hosts is crucial for rational drug development. Transcriptomic studies may help investigations of these mechanisms by determining which genes are expressed specifically during infection. This task has been difficult so far, since the proportion of microbial biomass in infected tissues is often extremely low, thus limiting the depth of sequencing and comprehensive transcriptome analysis. Here, we adapted a technology to capture and enrich C. albicans RNA, which was next used for deep RNA sequencing directly from infected tissues from two different host organisms. The high-resolution transcriptome revealed a large number of genes that were so far unknown to participate in infection, which will likely constitute a focus of study in the future. More importantly, this method may be adapted to perform transcript profiling of any other microbes during host infection or colonization.},

Multi-protein sequence comparisons among fungi suggest that there are two classes of Rim9/PalI proteins; longer proteins like PalI that contain a Sur7 domain and a C-terminal extension, and shorter proteins like Rim9 that contain essentially only the Sur7 domain. We have examined possible roles of the longer, PalI-like proteins of both Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Yol019w) and Candida albicans (Orf19.1510/Srd1), two species that also contain short Rim9 proteins required for alkaline-associated stress responses. Deletions of the long form genes did not create any significant stress response phenotype in either S. cerevisiae or C. albicans, nor did the deletions enhance any of the rim9 deletion effects when combined in a double mutant. Furthermore, challenges in C. albicans show RIM9 but not SRD1 is important for proper response and hyphal formation. It appears that in fungal species such as Aspergillus nidulans containing only a long-form PalI-like protein, this element functions in the process of stress response, while in fungi with both versions the response to stress function is limited to the short-form protein.},

  abstract = {Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis are pathogenic fungi that are highly related but differ in virulence and in some phenotypic traits. During in vitro growth on certain nutrient-poor media, C. albicans and C. dubliniensis are the only yeast species which are able to produce chlamydospores, large thick-walled cells of unknown function. Interestingly, only C. dubliniensis forms pseudohyphae with abundant chlamydospores when grown on Staib medium, while C. albicans grows exclusively as a budding yeast. In order to further our understanding of chlamydospore development and assembly, we compared the global transcriptional profile of both species during growth in liquid Staib medium by RNA sequencing. We also included a C. albicans mutant in our study which lacks the morphogenetic transcriptional repressor Nrg1. This strain, which is characterized by its constitutive pseudohyphal growth, specifically produces masses of chlamydospores in Staib medium, similar to C. dubliniensis. This comparative approach identified a set of putatively chlamydospore-related genes. Two of the homologous C. albicans and C. dubliniensis genes (CSP1 and CSP2) which were most strongly upregulated during chlamydospore development were analysed in more detail. By use of the green fluorescent protein as a reporter, the encoded putative cell wall related proteins were found to exclusively localize to C. albicans and C. dubliniensis chlamydospores. Our findings uncover the first chlamydospore specific markers in Candida species and provide novel insights in the complex morphogenetic development of these important fungal pathogens.},

  abstract = {Manipulating the apoptotic response of Candida albicans may help in the control of this opportunistic pathogen. The metacaspase Mca1p has been described as a key protease for apoptosis in C. albicans but little is known about its cleavage specificity and substrates. We therefore initiated a series of studies to describe its function. We used a strain disrupted for the MCA1 gene (mca1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$}) and compared its proteome to that of a wild-type isogenic strain, in the presence and absence of a known inducer of apoptosis, the quorum-sensing molecule farnesol. Label-free and TMT labeling quantitative proteomic analyses showed that both mca1 disruption and farnesol treatment significantly affected the proteome of the cells. The combination of both conditions led to an unexpected biological response: the strong overexpression of proteins implicated in the general stress. We studied sites cleaved by Mca1p using native peptidomic techniques, and a bottom-up approach involving GluC endoprotease: there appeared to be a ``K/R'' substrate specificity in P1 and a ``D/E'' specificity in P2. We also found 77 potential substrates of Mca1p, 13 of which validated using the most stringent filters, implicated in protein folding, protein aggregate resolubilization, glycolysis, and a number of mitochondrial functions. An immunoblot assay confirmed the cleavage of Ssb1p, a member of the HSP70 family of heat-shock proteins, in conditions where the metacaspase is activated. These various results indicate that Mca1p is involved in a limited and specific proteolysis program triggered by apoptosis. One of the main functions of Mca1p appears to be the degradation of several major heat-shock proteins, thereby contributing to weakening cellular defenses and amplifying the cell death process. Finally, Mca1p appears to contribute significantly to the control of mitochondria biogenesis and degradation. Consequently, Mca1p may be a link between the extrinsic and the intrinsic programmed cell death pathways in C. albicans.},

  abstract = {The Mediator complex is an essential co-regulator of RNA polymerase II that is conserved throughout eukaryotes. Here we present the first study of Mediator in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. We focused on the Middle domain subunit Med31, the Head domain subunit Med20, and Srb9/Med13 from the Kinase domain. The C. albicans Mediator shares some roles with model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, such as functions in the response to certain stresses and the role of Med31 in the expression of genes regulated by the activator Ace2. The C. albicans Mediator also has additional roles in the transcription of genes associated with virulence, for example genes related to morphogenesis and gene families enriched in pathogens, such as the ALS adhesins. Consistently, Med31, Med20, and Srb9/Med13 contribute to key virulence attributes of C. albicans, filamentation, and biofilm formation; and ALS1 is a biologically relevant target of Med31 for development of biofilms. Furthermore, Med31 affects virulence of C. albicans in the worm infection model. We present evidence that the roles of Med31 and Srb9/Med13 in the expression of the genes encoding cell wall adhesins are different between S. cerevisiae and C. albicans: they are repressors of the FLO genes in S. cerevisiae and are activators of the ALS genes in C. albicans. This suggests that Mediator subunits regulate adhesion in a distinct manner between these two distantly related fungal species.},

  volume = {7},
  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {Perception of external stimuli and generation of an appropriate response are crucial for host colonization by pathogens. In pathogenic fungi, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways regulate dimorphism, biofilm/mat formation, and virulence. Signaling mucins, characterized by a heavily glycosylated extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a small cytoplasmic domain, are known to regulate various signaling pathways. In Candida albicans, the mucin Msb2 regulates the Cek1 MAPK pathway. We show here that Msb2 is localized to the yeast cell wall and is further enriched on hyphal surfaces. A msb2{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} strain formed normal hyphae but had biofilm defects. Cek1 (but not Mkc1) phosphorylation was absent in the msb2{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} mutant. The extracellular domain of Msb2 was shed in cells exposed to elevated temperature and carbon source limitation, concomitant with germination and Cek1 phosphorylation. Msb2 shedding occurred differentially in cells grown planktonically or on solid surfaces in the presence of cell wall and osmotic stressors. We further show that Msb2 shedding and Cek1 phosphorylation were inhibited by addition of Pepstatin A (PA), a selective inhibitor of aspartic proteases (Saps). Analysis of combinations of Sap protease mutants identified a sap8{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} mutant with reduced MAPK signaling along with defects in biofilm formation, thereby suggesting that Sap8 potentially serves as a major regulator of Msb2 processing. We further show that loss of either Msb2 (msb2{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$}) or Sap8 (sap8{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$}) resulted in higher C. albicans surface {$\beta$}-glucan exposure and msb2{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} showed attenuated virulence in a murine model of oral candidiasis. Thus, Sap-mediated proteolytic cleavage of Msb2 is required for activation of the Cek1 MAPK pathway in response to environmental cues including those that induce germination. Inhibition of Msb2 processing at the level of Saps may provide a means of attenuating MAPK signaling and reducing C. albicans virulence.},

In this work, a free-gel proteomic strategy based on tryptic digestion of live yeast and hyphae cells and protein identification using LC\textendash{}MS/MS methodology was used to identify cell surface proteins. Using this strategy, a total of 943 proteins were identified, of which 438 were in yeast and 928 were in hyphae. Of these proteins, 79 were closely related to the organization and biogenesis of the cell wall, including 28 GPI-anchored proteins, such as Hyr1 and Sod5 which were detected exclusively in hyphae, and Als2 and Sap10which were detected only in yeast. A group of 17 proteins of unknown function were subsequently studied by analysis of the corresponding deletion mutants. We found that four new proteins, Pst3, Tos1, Orf19.3060 and Orf19.5352 are involved in cell wall integrity and in C. albicans' engulfment by macrophages. Moreover, the putative NADH-ubiquinone-related proteins, Ali1, Mci4, Orf19.287 and Orf19.7590, are also involved in osmotic and oxidative resistance, yeast to hypha transition and the ability to damage and invade oral epithelial cells.

The use of this latter innovative procedure gave similar data as compared to the analysis of HF-pyridine extracted proteins.

After tryptic removal of the most accessible proteins in the cell wall, several of the same expected GPI proteins and the most commonly found ``atypical'' wall proteins were identified. This result suggests that proteins are located not only at the cell wall surface, but are embedded within the cell wall itself.

In the past, efforts have focused on synthesis of chitin and glucan, which confer mechanical strength and rigidity upon the cell wall. This paper describes the molecular analysis of CaMNT1, a gene involved in synthesis of mannoproteins, the third major class of macromolecule found in the cell wall. CaMNT1 encodes an {$\alpha$}-1,2-mannosyl transferase, which adds the second mannose residue in a tri-mannose oligosaccharide structure which represents O-linked mannan in C. albicans. The deduced amino acid sequence suggests that CaMnt1p is a type II membrane protein residing in a medial Golgi compartment. The absence of CaMnt1p reduced the ability of C. albicans cells to adhere to each other, to human buccal epithelial cells, and to rat vaginal epithelial cells. Both heterozygous and homozygous Camnt1 null mutants of C. albicans showed strong attenuation of virulence in guinea pig and mouse models of systemic candidosis, which, in guinea pigs, could be attributed to a decreased ability to reach and/or adhere internal organs. Therefore, correct CaMnt1p-mediated O-linked mannosylation of proteins is critical for adhesion and virulence of C. albicans.},

Reverse-transcription PCR analyses demonstrated that the majority of the glucose transporters was transcribed in culture medium containing 2\% glucose, while several were transcribed in the presence of low (0.2\%) and/or high (5\%) concentrations of glucose. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that there were three distinct clades of 20 HGT genes, which might represent three possible subfamilies. Additionally, HGT18 and HGT20 show a high overall sequence identity to the human GLUTs, indicating a possible functional convergence.

The C. albicans plasma membrane is an important interface in the host\textendash{}pathogen relationship. The plasma membrane proteins mediate a variety of functions, including sensing and signalling to the external environment, in which the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane proteins play a crucial role. A subproteomic approach to obtain a global picture of the protein composition of the C. albicans plasma membrane was developed, and different strategies were tested in order to extract the largest number of yeast plasma membrane proteins and GPI-anchored membrane proteins. These methods involved: (i) protoplast generation, (ii) mechanical disruption, (iii) ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients, and (iv) Na2CO3 treatments. To isolate GPI-anchored proteins two additional steps were performed: two-phase separation and phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C treatment. After LC-MS/MS analysis using both a MALDI-TOF/TOF and a linear ion trap quadrupole, a total of 214 membrane proteins were identified, including 41 already described as plasma membrane proteins, 20 plasma membrane associated proteins, and 22 proteins with unknown membrane localisation. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that this set of C. albicans membrane proteins is highly enriched in proteins involved in biopolymer biosynthesis or transport processes. Furthermore, after phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C treatment, 12 GPI-anchored membrane proteins were released and identified; most of them are associated with cell wall {$\beta$}-glucan synthesis and maintenance or are virulence factors, such as phospholipases or aspartyl proteinases.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Complement is a tightly controlled arm of the innate immune system, facilitating phagocytosis and killing of invading pathogens. Factor H (FH) is the main fluid-phase inhibitor of the alternative pathway. Many pathogens can hijack FH from the host and protect themselves from complement-dependent killing. Candida albicans is a clinically important opportunistic yeast, expressing different FH binding molecules on its cell surface, which allow complement evasion. One such FH binding molecule is the transmembrane protein ``High affinity glucose transporter 1'' (Hgt1p), involved in glucose metabolism. This study demonstrated that Hgt1p transcription and expression is induced and highest at the low, but physiological glucose concentration of 0.1\%, why this concentration was used throughout the study. We also demonstrated the transport of Hgt1p to the fungal cell wall surface by vesicle trafficking and its release by exosomes containing Hgt1p integrated in the vesicular membrane. We corroborated Hgt1p as FH binding molecule. A polyclonal anti-Hgt1p antibody was created which interfered with the binding of FH, present in normal human serum to the fungal cell wall . A chimeric molecule consisting of FH domains 6 and 7 fused to human IgG1 Fc (FH6.7/Fc) even more comprehensively blocked FH binding, likely because FH6.7/Fc diverted FH away from fungal FH ligands other than Hgt1p. Reduced FH binding to the yeast was associated with a concomitant increase in C3b/iC3b deposition, resulted in significantly increased in vitro phagocytosis and killing by human neutrophils.In conclusion, Hgt1p also exhibits non-canonical functions such as binding FH after its export to the cell wall. Blocking Hgt1p-FH interactions may represent a tool to enhance complement activation on the fungal surface to promote phagocytosis and killing of C. albicans.},

  abstract = {Fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (Faa) activates fatty acid (FA) by converting the FA into the CoA ester in the cell. In the present study, we characterized a FAA homologue (CaFAA4) from the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans. Most organisms can not only synthesize long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs (LCFA-CoAs) endogenously using a fatty acid synthase (Fas) activity but also can uptake long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) from the extracellular environment and convert them into LCFA-CoAs via a vectorial acylation system. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses two LCFA-CoA synthetases, ScFaa1p and ScFaa4p. The disruption of ScFAA1 and ScFAA4 leads to synthetic lethality in the presence of a fatty acid synthesis inhibitor\textemdash{}cerulenin. The homologue\textemdash{}CaFAA4\textemdash{}rescued the lethality of an S. cerevisiae Scfaa1\textendash{}Scfaa4 double mutant in the presence of cerulenin. On the other hand, a C. albicans faa4 mutant was unable to grow in the presence of cerulenin even if LCFAs were provided exogenously. Moreover, a biofilm analysis showed that the metabolic activity of the Cafaa4 mutant was approximately 40\% lower than that of the wild-type parent, even though there was no significant difference in cell number or cell morphology between these strains. Notably, the Cafaa4 mutant showed increased susceptibility to micafungin during biofilm formation, a phenotype that presumably can be attributed to the impaired metabolism of the mutant strain. These results indicated that CaFaa4p is the unique C. albicans Faa protein responsible for activating LCFAs and is involved in the metabolism of biofilms.},

  volume = {81},
  issn = {0950-382X},
  abstract = {Summary Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses two proteins that together support high-affinity Fe-uptake. These are a multicopper oxidase, Fet3p, with specificity towards Fe2+ and a ferric iron permease, Ftr1p, which supports Fe-accumulation. Homologues of the genes encoding these two proteins are found in all fungal genomes including those for the pathogens, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. At least one of these loci represents a virulence factor for each pathogen suggesting that this complex would be an appropriate pharmacologic target. However, the mechanism by which this protein pair supports Fe-uptake in any fungal pathogen has not been elucidated. Taking advantage of the robust molecular genetics available in S. cerevisiae, we identify the two of five candidate ferroxidases likely involved in high-affinity Fe-uptake in C. albicans, Fet31 and Fet34. Both localize to the yeast plasma membrane and both support Fe-uptake along with an Ftr1 protein, either from C. albicans or from S. cerevisiae. We express and characterize Fet34, demonstrating that it is functionally homologous to ScFet3p. Using S. cerevisiae as host for the functional expression of the C. albicans Fe-uptake proteins, we demonstrate that they support a mechanism of Fe-trafficking that involves channelling of the CaFet34-generated Fe3+ directly to CaFtr1 for transport into the cytoplasm.},

However, this disparity in virulence is surprising given the high level of sequence conservation and the wide range of phenotypic traits shared by these two species. Increased sensitivity to environmental stresses has been suggested to be a possible contributory factor to the lower virulence of C. dubliniensis. In this study, we investigated, in the first comparison of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis by transcriptional profiling, global gene expression in each species when grown under conditions in which the two species exhibit differential stress tolerance. The profiles revealed similar core responses to stresses in both species, but differences in the amplitude of the general transcriptional responses to thermal, salt and oxidative stress. Differences in the regulation of specific stress genes were observed between the two species. In particular, ENA21, encoding a sodium ion transporter, was strongly induced in C. albicans but not in C. dubliniensis. In addition, ENA21 was identified in a forward genetic screen for C. albicans genomic sequences that increase salt tolerance in C. dubliniensis. Introduction of a single copy of CaENA21 was subsequently shown to be sufficient to confer salt tolerance upon C. dubliniensis.},

  abstract = {Although a variety of affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) strategies have been used to investigate complex interactions, many of these are susceptible to artifacts because of substantial overexpression of the exogenously expressed bait protein. Here we present a logical and systematic workflow that uses the multifunctional Halo tag to assess the correct localization and behavior of tagged subunits of the Sin3 histone deacetylase complex prior to further AP-MS analysis. Using this workflow, we modified our tagging/expression strategy with 21.7\% of the tagged bait proteins that we constructed, allowing us to quickly develop validated reagents. Specifically, we apply the workflow to map interactions between stably expressed versions of the Sin3 subunits SUDS3, SAP30, or SAP30L and other cellular proteins. Here we show that the SAP30 and SAP30L paralogues strongly associate with the core Sin3 complex, but SAP30L has unique associations with the proteasome and the myelin sheath. Next, we demonstrate an advancement of the complex NSAF (cNSAF) approach, in which normalization to the scaffold protein SIN3A accounts for variations in the proportion of each bait capturing Sin3 complexes and allows a comparison among different baits capturing the same protein complex. This analysis reveals that although the Sin3 subunit SUDS3 appears to be used in both SIN3A and SIN3B based complexes, the SAP30 subunit is not used in SIN3B based complexes. Intriguingly, we do not detect the Sin3 subunits SAP18 and SAP25 among the 128 high-confidence interactions identified, suggesting that these subunits may not be common to all versions of the Sin3 complex in human cells. This workflow provides the framework for building validated reagents to assemble quantitative interaction networks for chromatin remodeling complexes and provides novel insights into focused protein interaction networks.},

So far, these changes have been linked to mesenchymal alterations, the epithelial consequences of collagen VII loss remaining under-addressed. As epithelial dysfunction is a principal initiator of fibrosis, we performed a comprehensive transcriptome and proteome profiling of primary human keratinocytes from DEB and control subjects to generate global and detailed images of dysregulated epidermal molecular pathways linked to loss of collagen VII. These revealed downregulation of interaction partners of collagen VII on mRNA and protein level, but also increased abundance of S100 pro-inflammatory proteins in primary DEB keratinocytes. Increased TGF-{$\beta$} signaling because of loss of collagen VII was associated with enhanced activity of lysosomal proteases in both keratinocytes and skin of collagen VII-deficient individuals. Thus, loss of a single structural protein, collagen VII, has extra- and intracellular consequences, resulting in inflammatory processes that enable tissue destabilization and promote keratinocyte-driven, progressive fibrosis.},

  volume = {0},
  issn = {null},
  abstract = {Inter-cellular and inter-kingdom signaling systems of various levels of complexity regulate pathogenic and mutualistic interactions between bacteria, parasites, and fungi and animal and plant hosts. Inter-kingdom interactions between mutualistic bacteria such as rhizobia and legumes during nodulation and between fungi and plants during mycorrhizal associations, are characterized by the extensive exchange of molecular signals, which allow nitrogen and phosphate assimilation, respectively. A novel aspect of this signaling exchange is the existence of specific structures, the exosomes, that carry important molecules that shape the plant\textendash{}pathogen interactions. Exosomes contain a wide array of molecules, such as lipids, proteins, messenger RNA, and microRNAs, that play important roles in cell-to-cell communication in animal and plant cells by affecting gene expression and other physiological activity in distant cells within the same organism (e.g., during cancer metastases and neuron injuries). In plant cells, it has been recently reported that exosomes go beyond organism boundaries and inhibit a pathogenic interaction in plants. Plant produce and send exosomes loaded with specific small miRNA which inhibit the pathogen infection, but the pathogen can also produce exosomes carrying pro-pathogenic proteins and microRNAs. Therefore, exosomes are the important bridge regulating the signal exchange. Exosomes are small membrane-bound vesicles derived from multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which carries selected cargos from the cytoplasm (protein, lipids, and microRNAs) and under certain circumstances, they fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing the small vesicles as cargo-carrying exosomes into the extracellular space during intercellular and inter-kingdom communication. Animal and plant proteomic studies have demonstrated that tetraspanin proteins are an integral part of exosome membranes, positioning tetraspanins as essential components for endosome organization, with key roles in membrane fusion, cell trafficking, and membrane recognition. We discuss the similarities and differences between animal tetraspanins and plant tetraspanins formed during plant\textendash{}microbe interactions and their potential role in mutualistic communication.},

  abstract = {Target deconvolution is one of the most challenging tasks in drug discovery, but a key step in drug development. In contrast to small molecules, there is a lack of validated and robust methodologies for target elucidation of peptides. In particular, it is difficult to apply these methods to cyclic and cysteine-stabilized peptides since they exhibit reduced amenability to chemical modification and affinity capture; however, such ribosomal synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide natural products are rich sources of promising drug candidates. For example, plant-derived circular peptides called cyclotides have recently attracted much attention due to their immunosuppressive effects and oral activity in the treatment of multiple sclerosis in mice, but their molecular target has hitherto not been reported. In this study a chemical proteomics approach using photo-affinity crosslinking was developed to determine a target of the circular peptide [T20K]kalata B1. Using this prototypic nature-derived peptide enabled the identification of a possible modulation of 14-3-3 proteins. This biochemical interaction was validated via competition pull down assays as well as a cellular reporter assay indicating an effect on 14-3-3-dependent transcriptional activity. As proof of concept, the presented approach may be applicable for target elucidation of various cyclic peptides and mini-proteins, in particular cyclotides, which represent a promising class of molecules in drug discovery and development.},

Highlights

First comparative proteomic analysis of white and brown adipocyte secretomes.100 novel adipokines differentially secreted from white versus brown adipocytes.Functionally enriched protein class changes in white and brown adipocytes.200 novel, NE-responsive adipokines from brown adipocytes.
The adipose organ, including white and brown adipose tissues, is an important player in systemic energy homeostasis, storing excess energy in form of lipids while releasing energy upon various energy demands. Recent studies have demonstrated that white and brown adipocytes also function as endocrine cells and regulate systemic metabolism by secreting factors that act locally and systemically. However, a comparative proteomic analysis of secreted factors from white and brown adipocytes and their responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation has not been reported yet. Therefore, we studied and compared the secretome of white and brown adipocytes, with and without norepinephrine (NE) stimulation. Our results reveal that carbohydrate-metabolism-regulating proteins are preferably secreted from white adipocytes, while brown adipocytes predominantly secrete a large variety of proteins. Upon NE stimulation, an increased secretion of known adipokines is favored by white adipocytes while brown adipocytes secreted higher amounts of novel adipokines. Furthermore, the secretory response between NE-stimulated and basal state was multifaceted addressing lipid and glucose metabolism, adipogenesis, and antioxidative reactions. Intriguingly, NE stimulation drastically changed the secretome in brown adipocytes. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive catalogue of novel adipokine candidates secreted from white and brown adipocytes with many of them responsive to NE. Given the beneficial effects of brown adipose tissue activation on its endocrine function and systemic metabolism, this study provides an archive of novel batokine candidates and biomarkers for activated brown adipose tissue.},

  abstract = {The capacity to regenerate the spinal cord after an injury is a coveted trait that only a limited group of nonmammalian organisms can achieve. In Xenopus laevis, this capacity is only present during larval or tadpole stages, but is absent during postmetamorphic frog stages. This provides an excellent model for comparative studies between a regenerative and a nonregenerative stage to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that explain this difference in regenerative potential. Here, we used iTRAQ chemistry to obtain a quantitative proteome of the spinal cord 1 day after a transection injury in regenerative and nonregenerative stage animals, and used sham operated animals as controls. We quantified a total of 6,384 proteins, with 172 showing significant differential expression in the regenerative stage and 240 in the nonregenerative stage, with an overlap of only 14 proteins. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that although the regenerative stage downregulated synapse/vesicle and mitochondrial proteins, the nonregenerative stage upregulated lipid metabolism proteins, and downregulated ribosomal and translation control proteins. Furthermore, STRING network analysis showed that proteins belonging to these groups are highly interconnected, providing interesting candidates for future functional studies.

  abstract = {In prostate cancer and other malignancies sensitive and robust biomarkers are lacking or have relevant limitations. Prostate specific antigen (PSA), the only biomarker widely used in prostate cancer, is suffering from low specificity. Exosomes offer new perspectives in the discovery of blood-based biomarkers. Here we present a proof-of principle study for a proteomics-based identification pipeline, implementing existing data sources, to exemplarily identify exosome-based biomarker candidates in prostate cancer.
Exosomes from malignant PC3 and benign PNT1A cells and from FBS-containing medium were isolated using sequential ultracentrifugation. Exosome and control samples were analyzed on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. Proteomic data is available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD003651. We developed a scoring scheme to rank 64 proteins exclusively found in PC3 exosomes, integrating data from four public databases and published mass spectrometry data sets. Among the top candidates, we focused on the tight junction protein claudin 3. Retests under serum-free conditions using immunoblotting and immunogold labeling confirmed the presence of claudin 3 on PC3 exosomes. Claudin 3 levels were determined in the blood plasma of patients with localized (n = 58; 42 with Gleason score 6\textendash{}7, 16 with Gleason score {$\geq$}8) and metastatic prostate cancer (n = 11) compared with patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 15) and healthy individuals (n = 15) using ELISA, without prior laborious exosome isolation. ANOVA showed different CLDN3 plasma levels in these groups (p = 0.004). CLDN3 levels were higher in patients with Gleason {$\geq$}8 tumors compared with patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (p = 0.012) and Gleason 6\textendash{}7 tumors (p = 0.029). In patients with localized tumors CLDN3 levels predicted a Gleason score {$\geq$} 8 (AUC = 0.705; p = 0.016) and did not correlate with serum PSA.
By using the described workflow claudin 3 was identified and validated as a potential blood-based biomarker in prostate cancer. Furthermore this workflow could serve as a template to be used in other cancer entities.},

  issn = {1570-9639},
  abstract = {Extracellular vesicles comprise two main classes - exosomes and shed microvesicles (sMVs). Whilst much is known about exosome cargo content and functionality, sMVs are poorly understood. Here, we describe the large-scale purification of sMVs released from primary (SW480) and metastatic (SW620) human isogenic colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines using a combination of differential ultracentrifugation and isopycnic iodixanol density centrifugation. The yield of SW480-sMVs and SW620-sMVs was 0.75 mg and 0.80 mg, respectively. Both SW480-/SW620-sMVs are heterogeneous in size (100\textendash{}600 nm diameter) and exhibit identical buoyant densities (1.10 g/mL). In contrast to exosomes, sMVs are ALIX-, TSG101-, CD63- and CD9-. Quantitative mass spectrometry identified 1295 and 1300 proteins in SW480-sMVs and SW620-sMVs, respectively. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis identified `cell adhesion' (CDH1, OCLN, CTN families), `signalling pathway' (KRAS, NRAS, MAPK1, MAP2K1), and `translation/RNA related' processes (EIF, RPL, HNRNP families) in both sMV types. Strikingly, SW480- and SW620-sMVs exhibit distinct protein signatures - SW480-sMVs being enriched in ITGA/B, ANXA1, CLDN7, CD44 and EGFR/NOTCH signalling networks, while SW620-sMVs are enriched in PRKCA, MACC1, FGFR4 and MTOR/MARCKS signalling networks. Both SW480- and SW620-sMVs are taken up by NIH3T3 fibroblasts resulting in similar cell invasion capability. This study provides, for the first time, molecular insights into sMVs and CRC biology.},

  abstract = {The complexity of human tissue fluid precludes timely identification of cancer biomarkers by immunoassay or mass spectrometry. An increasingly attractive strategy is to primarily enrich extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from cancer cells in an accelerated manner compared to normal cells. The Vn96 peptide was herein employed to recover a subset of EVs released into the media from cellular models of breast cancer. Vn96 has affinity for heat shock proteins (HSPs) decorating the surface of EVs. Reflecting their cells of origin, cancer EVs displayed discrete differences from those of normal phenotype. GELFrEE LC/MS identified an extensive proteome from all three sources of EVs, the vast majority having been previously reported in the ExoCarta database. Pathway analysis of the Vn96-affinity proteome unequivocally distinguished EVs from tumorigenic cell lines (SKBR3 and MCF-7) relative to a non-tumorigenic source (MCF-10a), particularly with regard to altered metabolic enzymes, signaling, and chaperone proteins. The protein data sets provide valuable information from material shed by cultured cells. It is probable that a vast amount of biomarker identities may be collected from established and primary cell cultures using the approaches described here.},

Extracellular vesicles in body fluids offer a unique opportunity for integrative biomarker approaches due to their complex biocargo that includes proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and metabolites. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics data suggest that a significant portion of human proteins are sorted into extracellular vesicles and amenable for biomarker discovery schemes.Areas covered: this review focuses on key aspects of isolation, quality control and subsequent analysis of blood plasma- and conditioned medium-derived extracellular vesicle proteins, and summarizes the current state-of-the-art in the field. Furthermore, it provides introduction and guidelines for mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles.Expert commentary: Comparison of newly developed isolation and purification techniques with classical ultracentrifugation-based approaches are highly recommended. It is also essential to use multiple analytical approaches to characterize the isolated extracellular vesicles prior to characterization of their biocargo. Rigor in data reproducibility, critical data analysis, awareness of potential pitfalls, standardization and benchmarking are required for extracellular vesicle research to fulfil the current expectation that these subcellular structures can become a valid source of next generation biomarkers.},

  abstract = {Ubiquitin-binding proteins play an important role in eukaryotes by translating differently linked polyubiquitin chains into proper cellular responses. Current knowledge about ubiquitin-binding proteins and ubiquitin linkage-selective interactions is mostly based on case-by-case studies. We have recently reported a method called ubiquitin interactor affinity enrichment\textendash{}mass spectrometry (UbIA-MS), which enables comprehensive identification of ubiquitin interactors for all ubiquitin linkages from crude cell lysates. One major strength of UbIA-MS is the fact that ubiquitin interactors are enriched from crude cell lysates, in which proteins are present at endogenous levels, contain biologically relevant post-translational modifications (PTMs) and are assembled in native protein complexes. In addition, UbIA-MS uses chemically synthesized nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin, which mimics native diubiquitin and is inert to cleavage by endogenous deubiquitinases (DUBs). Here, we present a detailed protocol for UbIA-MS that proceeds in five stages: (i) chemical synthesis of ubiquitin precursors and click chemistry for the generation of biotinylated nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin baits, (ii) in vitro affinity purification of ubiquitin interactors, (iii) on-bead interactor digestion, (iv) liquid chromatography (LC)\textendash{}MS/MS analysis and (v) data analysis to identify differentially enriched proteins. The computational analysis tools are freely available as an open-source R software package, including a graphical interface. Typically, UbIA-MS allows the identification of dozens to hundreds of ubiquitin interactors from any type of cell lysate, and can be used to study cell type or stimulus-dependent ubiquitin interactions. The nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin synthesis can be completed in 3 weeks, followed by ubiquitin interactor enrichment and identification, which can be completed within another 2 weeks.},

However, it has been unclear how oxysterols influence Hedgehog signaling, including whether their effects are mediated through a protein target or indirectly through effects on membrane properties. To answer this question, we synthesized the enantiomer and an epimer of the most potent oxysterol, 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol. Using these molecules, we show that the effects of oxysterols on Hedgehog signaling are exquisitely stereoselective, consistent with the hypothesis that they function through a specific protein target. We present several lines of evidence that this protein target is the seven-pass transmembrane protein Smoothened, a major drug target in oncology. Our work suggests that these enigmatic sterols, which have multiple effects on cell physiology, may act as ligands for signaling receptors and provides a generally applicable framework for probing sterol signaling mechanisms.},

Prominent among the newly identified interacting proteins were enzymes that regulate sugars, glycerolipids and cholesterol itself as well as proteins involved in vesicular transport and protein glycosylation and degradation, pointing to key nodes in biochemical pathways that may couple sterol concentrations to the control of other metabolites and protein localization and modification.},

Among them are molecules which mediate adhesion to and invasion into host cells, the secretion of hydrolases, the yeast-to-hypha transition, contact sensing and thigmotropism, biofilm formation, phenotypic switching and a range of fitness attributes. Our understanding of when and how these mechanisms and factors contribute to infection has significantly increased during the last years. In addition, novel virulence mechanisms have recently been discovered. In this review we present an update on our current understanding of the pathogenicity mechanisms of this important human pathogen.},

It is a dimorphic fungus that undergoes a complex transformation in vivo, with mycelia in the environment producing conidia, which probably act as infectious propagules upon inhalation into the lungs, where they transform to the pathogenic yeast form. This transition is readily induced in vitro by temperature changes, resulting in modulation of the composition of the cell wall. Notably, the polymer linkages change from {$\beta$}-glucan to {$\alpha$}-glucan, possibly to avoid {$\beta$}-glucan triggering the inflammatory response. Mammalian oestrogens inhibit this transition, giving rise to a higher incidence of disease in males. Furthermore, the susceptibility of individuals to paracoccidioidomycosis has a genetic basis, which results in a depressed cellular immune response in susceptible patients; resistance is conferred by cytokine-stimulated granuloma formation and nitric oxide production. The latency period and persistence of the disease and the apparent lack of efficacy of humoral immunity are consistent with P. brasiliensis existing as a facultative intracellular pathogen.},

Extensive comparative genomic analysis demonstrates that ESCRT factors are well conserved across the eukaryotic lineage and complexes I, II, III and III-associated are almost completely retained, indicating an early evolutionary origin. The conspicuous exception is ESCRT 0, which functions in recognition of ubiquitylated cargo, and is restricted to the Opisthokonta, suggesting that a distinct mechanism likely operates in the vast majority of eukaryotic organisms. Additional analysis suggests that ESCRT III and ESCRT III-associated components evolved through a concerted model. Functional conservation of the ESCRT system is confirmed by direct study in trypanosomes. Despite extreme sequence divergence, epitope-tagged ESCRT factors TbVps23 and TbVps28 localize to the endosomal pathway, placing the trypanosome multivesicular body (MVB) in juxtaposition to the early endosome and lysosome. Knockdown of TbVps23 partially prevents degradation of an ubiquitylated endocytosed transmembrane domain protein. Therefore, despite the absence of an ESCRT 0 complex, the trypanosome ESCRT/MVB system functions similarly to that of opisthokonts. Thus the ESCRT system is an ancient and well-conserved feature of eukaryotic cells but with key differences between diverse lineages.},

The 3 human complement regulators, when attached to candida Gpd2, became functionally active, and the attached host proteins assist in inactivation of the complement cascade or cleave fibrinogen in the extracellular matrix component fibrinogen. Polyclonal Gpd2 anti-serum was generated and localized Gpd2 at the surface of C. albicans. In addition, candida Gpd2 bound to human nonphagocytic cells but not to phagocytic U937 cells.

In this study, we determined that exosome production by the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 requires the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport and that trafficking of mycobacterial proteins from phagocytosed bacilli to exosomes was dependent on protein ubiquitination. Moreover, soluble mycobacterial proteins, when added exogenously to RAW264.7 or human HEK293 cells, were endocytosed, ubiquitinated, and released via exosomes. This suggested that endocytosed proteins could be recycled from cells through exosomes. This hypothesis was supported using the tumor-associated protein He4, which, when endocytosed by RAW264.7 or HEK293 cells, was transported to exosomes in a ubiquitin-dependent manner. Our data suggest that ubiquitination is a modification sufficient for trafficking soluble proteins within the phagocytic/endocytic network to exosomes.},

Specifically, we identified mutations in the V0 ``a'' subunit VHA-5 that affect either the V0-specific function or the V0+V1 function of the V-ATPase. These mutations allowed us to establish that the V0 sector mediates secretion of Hedgehog-related proteins.

Microvesicles are heterogeneous membrane-bound sacs that are shed from the surface of cells into the extracellular environment in a highly regulated process. They are shed following the selective incorporation of a host of molecular cargo including multiple types of proteins and nucleic acids. In addition to providing new insight into the etiology of complex human diseases, microvesicles also show great promise as a tool for advanced diagnosis and therapy as we move forward into a new age of personalized medicine.

  abstract = {From bacteria to humans, cells secrete a large variety of membrane-bound extracellular vesicles. Only relatively recently has it however started to become clear that the exovesicular transport of proteins and RNAs is important for normal physiology and numerous pathological conditions. Extracellular vesicles can be formed through the release of the intralumenal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes as so-called exosomes, or through direct, ectosomal, budding from the cell surface. Through their ability to promote the bending of membranes away from the cytoplasm, the components of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) have been implicated in both exo- and ectosomal biogenesis. Studies of the ESCRT machinery may therefore provide important insights into the formation and function of extracellular vesicles. In the present review, we first describe the cell biological mechanisms through which ESCRT components contribute to the biogenesis of different types of extracellular vesicles. We then discuss how recent functional studies have started to uncover important roles of ESCRT-dependent extracellular vesicles in a wide variety of processes, including the transport of developmental signaling molecules and embryonic morphogenesis, the regulation of social behavior and host-pathogen interactions, as well as the etiology and progression of neurodegenerative pathologies and cancer.},

  abstract = {Cells release nano-sized membrane vesicles that are involved in intercellular communication by transferring biological information between cells. It is generally accepted that cells release at least three types of extracellular vesicles (EVs): apoptotic bodies, microvesicles and exosomes. While a wide range of putative biological functions have been attributed to exosomes, they are assumed to represent a homogenous population of EVs. We hypothesized the existence of subpopulations of exosomes with defined molecular compositions and biological properties. Density gradient centrifugation of isolated exosomes revealed the presence of two distinct subpopulations, differing in biophysical properties and their proteomic and RNA repertoires. Interestingly, the subpopulations mediated differential effects on the gene expression programmes in recipient cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that cells release distinct exosome subpopulations with unique compositions that elicit differential effects on recipient cells. Further dissection of exosome heterogeneity will advance our understanding of exosomal biology in health and disease and accelerate the development of exosome-based diagnostics and therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Identification and validation of extracellular vesicle (EV)-associated biomarkers requires robust isolation and characterization protocols. We assessed the impact of some commonly implemented pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical variables in EV research. Centrifugal filters with different membrane types and pore sizes are used to reduce large volume biofluids prior to EV isolation or to concentrate EVs. We compared five commonly reported filters for their efficiency when using plasma, urine and EV-spiked PBS. Regenerated cellulose membranes with pore size of 10\,kDa recovered EVs the most efficient. Less than 40\% recovery was achieved with other filters. Next, we analyzed the effect of the type of protein assays to measure EV protein in colorimetric and fluorometric kits. The fluorometric assay Qubit measured low concentration EV and BSA samples the most accurately with the lowest variation among technical and biological replicates. Lastly, we quantified Optiprep remnants in EV samples from density gradient ultracentrifugation and demonstrate that size-exclusion chromatography efficiently removes Optiprep from EVs. In conclusion, choice of centrifugal filters and protein assays confound EV analysis and should be carefully considered to increase efficiency towards biomarker discovery. SEC-based removal of Optiprep remnants from EVs can be considered for downstream applications.},

  abstract = {Tumor cell invasion requires the molecular and physical adaptation of both the cell and its microenvironment. Here we show that tumor cells are able to switch between the use of microvesicles and invadopodia to facilitate invasion through the extracellular matrix. Invadopodia formation accompanies the mesenchymal mode of migration on firm matrices and is facilitated by Rac1 activation. On the other hand, during invasion through compliant and deformable environments, tumor cells adopt an amoeboid phenotype and release microvesicles. Notably, firm matrices do not support microvesicle release, whereas compliant matrices are not conducive to invadopodia biogenesis. Furthermore, Rac1 activation is required for invadopodia function, while its inactivation promotes RhoA activation and actomyosin contractility required for microvesicle shedding. Suppression of RhoA signaling blocks microvesicle formation but enhances the formation of invadopodia. Finally, we describe Rho-mediated pathways involved in microvesicle biogenesis through the regulation of myosin light chain phosphatase. Our findings suggest that the ability of tumor cells to switch between the aforementioned qualitatively distinct modes of invasion may allow for dissemination across different microenvironments.},

Extracellular vesicles from different cell-types including fungi have been found to deliver functional RNAs to recipient cells. In this study we assessed the presence of small RNAs in MalaEx and addressed if the levels of these RNAs differ when M. sympodialis is cultured at normal human skin pH versus the elevated pH present on the skin of patients with AE. The total number and the protein concentration of the released MalaEx harvested after 48 h culture did not differ significantly between the two pH conditions nor did the size of the vesicles. From small RNA sequence data, we identified a set of reads with well-defined start and stop positions, in a length range of 16 to 22 nucleotides consistently present in the MalaEx. The levels of small RNAs were not significantly differentially expressed between the two different pH conditions indicating that they are not influenced by the elevated pH level observed on the AE skin.},

The organism remains understudied and there are urgent needs for new methods of rapid disease diagnosis for timely therapy. Extracellular vesicles with encapsulated RNAs have recently been discovered to have great potential applications for disease diagnoses and treatments. To explore the utilization of ex-RNA in studies of mucormycosis, we have performed RNA-Seq of ex-sRNAs from two clinical strains of R. delemar. Approximately 3.3 and 3.2 million clean reads were obtained from FGSC-9543 and CDC-8219 strains, respectively. The median sequence length of the sRNAs was 22 nts, with a minimum of 18 and a maximum of 30 nts. Further annotation identified 560 and 526 miRNAs from FGSC-9543 and CDC-8219 strains, respectively. miRNA target prediction and analysis of GO and KEGG pathways have revealed that the regulation of metabolism, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and two-component system signaling are important during growth. We have also validated RNA-Seq by qRT-PCR and Northern blotting analysis of randomly selected miRNAs. Our results show that R. delemar has a rich reservoir of secreted ex-sRNAs and our studies could facilitate the development of improved diagnostic methods as well as elucidating virulence mechanisms for R. delemar infection.},

Here we explored how MalaEx are involved in host-microbe interactions by comparing protein content of MalaEx with that of the parental yeast cells, and by investigating interactions of MalaEx with cells in the skin. Cryo-electron tomography revealed a heterogeneous population of MalaEx. iTRAQ based quantitative proteomics identified in total 2439 proteins in all replicates of which 110 were enriched in MalaEx compared to the yeast cells. Among the MalaEx enriched proteins were two of the M. sympodialis allergens, Mala s 1 and s 7. Functional experiments indicated an active binding and internalization of MalaEx into human keratinocytes and monocytes, and MalaEx were found in close proximity of the nuclei using super-resolution fluorescence 3D-SIM imaging. Our results provides new insights into host-microbe interactions, supporting that MalaEx may have a role in the sensitization and maintenance of inflammation in AE by containing enriched amounts of allergens and with their ability to interact with skin cells.},

Proteomic analyses have the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of these adaptive responses by providing insight into post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that contribute to the outputs, as well as testing presumptions about the regulation of protein levels based on transcript profiling. Here, we used label-free, quantitative mass spectrometry to re-examine the response of the major fungal pathogen of humans, Candida albicans, to osmotic stress. Of the 1,262 proteins that were identified, 84 were down-regulated in response to 1M NaCl, reflecting the decrease in ribosome biogenesis and translation that often accompanies stress. The 64 up-regulated proteins included central metabolic enzymes required for glycerol synthesis, a key osmolyte for this yeast, as well as proteins with functions during stress. These data reinforce the view that adaptation to salt stress involves a transient reduction in ribosome biogenesis and translation together with the accumulation of the osmolyte, glycerol. The specificity of the response to salt stress is highlighted by the small proportion of quantified C. albicans proteins (5\%) whose relative elevated abundances were statistically significant.},

We confirmed the appearance of UExo having irregular globe-shapes in a dog by immunoblot detection of the exosome markers, TSG101 and CD9. Based on our previous data using KD model mice and the data obtained herein by next generation sequencing of UExo-derived microRNAs in dogs, miR-26a, miR-146a, miR-486, miR-21a, and miR-10a/b were selected as candidate microRNAs. In particular, UExo-derived miR-26a and miR-10a/b were significantly decreased in KD dogs, and miR-26a levels negatively correlated with deteriorated renal function compared to the other miRNAs. UExo-derived miR-21a levels corrected or not to that of internal control microRNAs in UExo, miR-26a and miR-191, significantly increased with renal dysfunction. In kidney tissues, the decrease of miR-26a and miR-10a/b in the glomerulus and miR-10b in the tubulointerstitium negatively correlated with deteriorated renal function and histopathology. Increased miR-21a in the tubulointerstitium rather than in the glomerulus correlated with deteriorated renal histopathology.

  abstract = {Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a highly-aggressive heterogeneous malignancy, typically diagnosed at advanced stage. An important area of mesothelioma biology and progression is understanding intercellular communication and the contribution of the secretome. Exosomes are secreted extracellular vesicles shown to shuttle cellular cargo and direct intercellular communication in the tumour microenvironment, facilitate immunoregulation and metastasis. In this study, quantitative proteomics was used to investigate MM-derived exosomes from distinct human models and identify select cargo protein networks associated with angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunoregulation. Utilising bioinformatics pathway/network analyses, and correlation with previous studies on tumour exosomes, we defined a select mesothelioma exosomal signature (mEXOS, 570 proteins) enriched in tumour antigens and various cancer-specific signalling (HPGD/ENO1/OSMR) and secreted modulators (FN1/ITLN1/MAMDC2/PDGFD/GBP1). Notably, such circulating cargo offers unique insights into mesothelioma progression and tumour microenvironment reprogramming. Functionally, we demonstrate that oncogenic exosomes facilitate the migratory capacity of fibroblast/endothelial cells, supporting the systematic model of MM progression associated with vascular remodelling and angiogenesis. We provide biophysical and proteomic characterisation of exosomes, define a unique oncogenic signature (mEXOS), and demonstrate the regulatory capacity of exosomes in cell migration/tube formation assays. These findings contribute to understanding tumour-stromal crosstalk in the context of MM, and potential new diagnostic and therapeutic extracellular targets.},

Released by many cell types, they transport proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids to distant recipient cells and contribute to important physiopathological processes. Standard current exosome isolation methods based on differential centrifugation protocols tend to induce aggregation of particles in highly concentrated suspensions and freezing of exosomes can induce damage and inconsistent biological activity. Trehalose is a natural, non-toxic sugar widely used as a protein stabilizer and cryoprotectant by the food and drug industry. Here we report that addition of 25 mM trehalose to pancreatic beta-cell exosome-like vesicle isolation and storage buffer narrows the particle size distribution and increases the number of individual particles per microgram of protein. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles induce an increase in particle concentration and in the width of the size distribution for exosome-like vesicles stored in PBS, but not in PBS 25 mM trehalose. No signs of lysis or incomplete vesicles were observed by cryo-electron tomography in PBS and trehalose samples. In macrophage immune assays, beta-cell extracellular vesicles in trehalose show consistently higher TNF-alpha cytokine secretion stimulation indexes suggesting improved preservation of biological activity. The addition of trehalose might be an attractive means to standardize experiments in the field of exosome research and downstream applications.},

  abstract = {Diverse pathogenic fungi secrete extracellular vesicles (EV) that contain macromolecules, including virulence factors that can modulate the host immune response. We recently demonstrated that the binding of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) modulates how Histoplasma capsulatum load and releases its extracellular vesicles (EV). In the present paper, we addressed a concentration-dependent impact on the fungus' EV loading and release with different mAb, as well as the pathophysiological role of these EV during the host-pathogen interaction. We found that the mAbs differentially regulate EV content in concentration-dependent and independent manners. Enzymatic assays demonstrated that laccase activity in EV from H. capsulatum opsonized with 6B7 was reduced, but urease activity was not altered. The uptake of H. capsulatum by macrophages pre-treated with EV, presented an antibody concentration-dependent phenotype. The intracellular killing of yeast cells was potently inhibited in macrophages pre-treated with EV from 7B6 (non-protective) mAb-opsonized H. capsulatum and this inhibition was associated with a decrease in the reactive-oxygen species generated by these macrophages. In summary, our findings show that opsonization quantitatively and qualitatively modifies H. capsulatum EV load and secretion leading to distinct effects on the host's immune effector mechanisms, supporting the hypothesis that EV sorting and secretion are dynamic mechanisms for a fine-tuned response by fungal cells.},

  abstract = {The human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans causes meningo-encephalitis. The polysaccharide capsule is an important virulence factor for this yeast-like fungus. Previously, we had shown that disruption of the CAP10 gene, encoding a putative xylosyltransferase, results in mutant cells that lack most of the capsular polysaccharides on the cell surface, but do not show a typical acapsular phenotype. In contrast to the acapsular cap59 mutant, cap10 did not induce maturation of dendritic cells when exposed to components of the immune system. In order to gain further insight into the causes of this phenotype displayed by the cap10 mutant, we performed a more in-depth phenotypic analysis of the cell wall and surface structures of this mutant compared to the wild type strain and acapsular mutant cap59. Moreover, we analyzed the cap10 mutant and the wild type strain for differential gene expression of, amongst others, enzymes that are involved in biogenesis of cell wall and capsule components. We conclude that a mutation in the CAP10 gene results in a pleiotropic phenotype with effects on different cellular processes affecting, amongst others, cell size, expression of virulence factors and size of extracellular vesicles.},

  abstract = {Protein quantification at proteome-wide scale is an important aim, enabling insights into fundamental cellular biology and serving to constrain experiments and theoretical models. While proteome-wide quantification is not yet fully routine, many datasets approaching proteome-wide coverage are becoming available through biophysical and MS techniques. Data of this type can be accessed via a variety of sources, including publication supplements and online data repositories. However, access to the data is still fragmentary, and comparisons across experiments and organisms are not straightforward. Here, we describe recent updates to our database resource ``PaxDb'' (Protein Abundances Across Organisms). PaxDb focuses on protein abundance information at proteome-wide scope, irrespective of the underlying measurement technique. Quantification data is reprocessed, unified, and quality-scored, and then integrated to build a meta-resource. PaxDb also allows evolutionary comparisons through precomputed gene orthology relations. Recently, we have expanded the scope of the database to include cell-line samples, and more systematically scan the literature for suitable datasets. We report that a significant fraction of published experiments cannot readily be accessed and/or parsed for quantitative information, requiring additional steps and efforts. The current update brings PaxDb to 414 datasets in 53 organisms, with (semi-) quantitative abundance information covering more than 300 000 proteins.},

The protein content of OMVs is suggested to be similar in composition to various sub-cellular locations of their parent bacterium. However, very little is known regarding the effect of bacterial growth stage on the size, content, and selective packaging of proteins into OMVs. In this study, the global proteome of Helicobacter pylori and their OMVs throughout bacterial growth are examined to determine if bacterial growth stage affected OMV cargo composition. Analysis of OMVs produced by H. pylori reveals that bacterial growth stage affects the size, composition, and selection of protein cargo into OMVs. Proteomic analysis identifies that the proteome of H. pylori OMVs is vastly different throughout bacterial growth and that OMVs contain a range of proteins compared to their parent bacteria. In addition, bacterial growth stage affects the ability of OMVs to induce the production of IL-8 by human epithelial cells. Therefore, the findings identify that the size, proteome, and immunogenicity of OMVs produced during various stages of bacterial growth is not comparable. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of considering the bacterial growth stage from which OMVs are isolated, as this will impact their size, protein composition, and ultimately their biological functions.},

  volume = {145},
  issn = {1046-5928},
  abstract = {Given the emergence of multi drug resistant Vibrio cholerae strains, there is an urgent need to characterize new anti-cholera targets. One such target is the enzyme dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS; EC 4.3.3.7), which catalyzes the first committed step in the diaminopimelate pathway. This pathway is responsible for the production of two key metabolites in bacteria and plants, namely meso-2,6-diaminopimelate and L-lysine. Here, we report the cloning, expression and purification of untagged and His-tagged recombinant DHDPS from V. cholerae (Vc-DHDPS) and provide comparative structural and kinetic analyses. Structural studies employing circular dichroism spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrate that the recombinant enzymes are folded and exist as dimers in solution. Kinetic analyses of untagged and His-tagged Vc-DHDPS show that the enzymes are functional with specific activities of 75.6 U/mg and 112 U/mg, KM (pyruvate) of 0.14 mM and 0.15 mM, KM (L-aspartate-4-semialdehyde) of 0.08 mM and 0.09 mM, and kcat of 34 and 46 s-1, respectively. These results demonstrate there are no significant changes in the structure and function of Vc-DHDPS upon the addition of an N-terminal His tag and, hence, the tagged recombinant product is suitable for future studies, including screening for new inhibitors as potential anti-cholera agents. Additionally, a polyclonal antibody raised against untagged Vc-DHDPS is validated for specifically detecting recombinant and native forms of the enzyme.},

  abstract = {Msb2 is a sensor protein in the plasma membrane of fungi. In the human fungal pathogen C. albicans Msb2 signals via the Cek1 MAP kinase pathway to maintain cell wall integrity and allow filamentous growth. Msb2 doubly epitope-tagged in its large extracellular and small cytoplasmic domain was efficiently cleaved during liquid and surface growth and the extracellular domain was almost quantitatively released into the growth medium. Msb2 cleavage was independent of proteases Sap9, Sap10 and Kex2. Secreted Msb2 was highly O-glycosylated by protein mannosyltransferases including Pmt1 resulting in an apparent molecular mass of {$>$}400 kDa. Deletion analyses revealed that the transmembrane region is required for Msb2 function, while the large N-terminal and the small cytoplasmic region function to downregulate Msb2 signaling or, respectively, allow its induction by tunicamycin. Purified extracellular Msb2 domain protected fungal and bacterial cells effectively from antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) histatin-5 and LL-37. AMP inactivation was not due to degradation but depended on the quantity and length of the Msb2 glycofragment. C. albicans msb2 mutants were supersensitive to LL-37 but not histatin-5, suggesting that secreted rather than cell-associated Msb2 determines AMP protection. Thus, in addition to its sensor function Msb2 has a second activity because shedding of its glycofragment generates AMP quorum resistance.},

  title = {Elevated Catalase Expression in a Fungal Pathogen Is a Double-Edged Sword of Iron},
  volume = {13},
  issn = {1553-7374},
  abstract = {Most fungal pathogens of humans display robust protective oxidative stress responses that contribute to their pathogenicity. The induction of enzymes that detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an essential component of these responses. We showed previously that ectopic expression of the heme-containing catalase enzyme in Candida albicans enhances resistance to oxidative stress, combinatorial oxidative plus cationic stress, and phagocytic killing. Clearly ectopic catalase expression confers fitness advantages in the presence of stress, and therefore in this study we tested whether it enhances fitness in the absence of stress. We addressed this using a set of congenic barcoded C. albicans strains that include doxycycline-conditional tetON-CAT1 expressors. We show that high basal catalase levels, rather than CAT1 induction following stress imposition, reduce ROS accumulation and cell death, thereby promoting resistance to acute peroxide or combinatorial stress. This conclusion is reinforced by our analyses of phenotypically diverse clinical isolates and the impact of stochastic variation in catalase expression upon stress resistance in genetically homogeneous C. albicans populations. Accordingly, cat1{$\Delta$} cells are more sensitive to neutrophil killing. However, we find that catalase inactivation does not attenuate C. albicans virulence in mouse or invertebrate models of systemic candidiasis. Furthermore, our direct comparisons of fitness in vitro using isogenic barcoded CAT1, cat1{$\Delta$} and tetON-CAT1 strains show that, while ectopic catalase expression confers a fitness advantage during peroxide stress, it confers a fitness defect in the absence of stress. This fitness defect is suppressed by iron supplementation. Also high basal catalase levels induce key iron assimilatory functions (CFL5, FET3, FRP1, FTR1). We conclude that while high basal catalase levels enhance peroxide stress resistance, they place pressure on iron homeostasis through an elevated cellular demand for iron, thereby reducing the fitness of C. albicans in iron-limiting tissues within the host.},

With the advanced development towards their clinical use and increasing versatility of potential applications, improving their tissue-specific targeting in order to enhance their functionality in drug delivery opened as a challenging engineering field. In the past, the question of specific intercellular contact has been addressed by decoration of the EV surface with agents able of specific target recognition. An attractive possibility here is the modification of strongly overexpressed EV surface marker proteins towards recognition of target cells. As these proteins are involved in a plethora of biological functions in EV biogenesis, cargo targeting and intercellular transfer, a minimal impact on protein architecture upon modifications is desirable, which would also increase the stability of the exosomal preparation intended for therapeutic use. This chapter focuses on the possibilities of engineering of the EV marker proteins towards antigen-recognition units broadly applicable to endow EVs with tissue-targeting functionality.},

  volume = {292},
  issn = {0021-9258, 1083-351X},
  abstract = {Tspan5 is a member of a subgroup of tetraspanins referred to as TspanC8. These tetraspanins directly interact with the metalloprotease ADAM10, regulate its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent trafficking, and differentially regulate its ability to cleave various substrates and activate Notch signaling. The study of Tspan5 has been limited by the lack of good antibodies. This study provides new insights into Tspan5 using new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including two mAbs recognizing both Tspan5 and the highly similar tetraspanin Tspan17. Using these mAbs, we show that endogenous Tspan5 associates with ADAM10 in human cell lines and in mouse tissues where it is the most abundant, such as the brain, the lung, the kidney, or the intestine. We also uncover two TspanC8-specific motifs in the large extracellular domain of Tspan5 that are important for ADAM10 interaction and exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. One of the anti-Tspan5 mAbs does not recognize Tspan5 associated with ADAM10, providing a convenient way to measure the fraction of Tspan5 not associated with ADAM10. This fraction is minor in the cell lines tested, and it increases upon transfection of cells with TspanC8 tetraspanins such as Tspan15 or Tspan33 that inhibit Notch signaling. Finally, two antibodies inhibit ligand-induced Notch signaling, and this effect is stronger in cells depleted of the TspanC8 tetraspanin Tspan14, further indicating that Tspan5 and Tspan14 can compensate for each other in Notch signaling.},

  abstract = {CD9, a 24-kDa member of the tetraspanin family, influences cellular growth and development, activation, adhesion, and motility. Our investigation focuses on the hypothesis that the CD9 second extracellular loop (EC2) is important in modulating cell adhesive events. Using a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell expression system, we previously reported that CD9 expression inhibited cell adhesion to fibronectin and fibronectin matrix assembly. For the first time, a functional epitope on CD9 EC2 that regulates these processes is described. Binding of mAb7, an EC2-specific anti-CD9 monoclonal antibody, reversed the CD9 inhibitory activity on CHO cell adhesion and fibronectin matrix assembly. This reversal of cell phenotype also was observed in CHO cells expressing CD9 EC2 truncations. Furthermore, our data showed that the EC2 sequence173LETFTVKSCPDAIKEVFDNK192 was largely responsible for the CD9-mediated CHO cell phenotype. Two peptides, 135K-V172 (peptide 5b) and168P-I185 (peptide 6a), selectively blocked mAb7 binding to soluble CD9 and to CD9 on intact cells. These active peptides reversed the influence of CD9 expression on CHO cell adhesion to fibronectin. In addition, confocal microscopy revealed that CD9 colocalized with the integrin {$\alpha$}5{$\beta$}1 and cytoskeletal F-actin in punctate clusters on the cell surface, particularly at the cell margins. Immunoprecipitation studies confirmed CD9 association with {$\beta$}1 integrin. The cellular distribution and colocalization of focal adhesion kinase and {$\alpha$}-actinin with cytoskeletal actin was also influenced by CD9 expression. Thus, CD9 may exhibit its effect by modulating the composition of adhesive complexes important in facilitating cell adhesion and matrix assembly.},

  abstract = {The use of PCR-based techniques for directed gene alterations has become a standard tool in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In our efforts to increase the speed of functional analysis of Candida albicans genes, we constructed a modular system of plasmid vectors and successfully applied PCR-amplified functional analysis (FA)-cassettes in the transformation of C. albicans. These cassettes facilitate: (a) gene disruptions; (b) tagging of 3{${'}$}-ends of genes with green fluorescent protein (GFP); and (c) replacements of endogenous promoters to achieve regulated expression. The modules consists of a core of three selectable marker genes, CaURA3, CaHIS1 and CaARG4. Modules for C-terminal GFP-tagging were generated by adding GFP-sequences flanked at the 5{${'}$}-end by a (Gly-Ala)3-linker and at the 3{${'}$}-end by the S. cerevisiae URA3-terminator to these selection markers. Promoter exchange modules consist of the respective marker genes followed by the regulatable CaMAL2 or CaMET3 promoters at their 3{${'}$}-ends. In order to ensure a reliably high rate of homologous gene targeting, the flanking homology regions required a size of 100 bp of gene-specific sequences, which were provided with the oligonucleotide primers. The use of shorter flanking homology regions produced unsatisfactory results with C. albicans strain BWP17. With these new modules only a minimal set of primers is required to achieve the functional analysis of C. albicans genes and, therefore, provides a basic tool to increase the number of functionally characterized C. albicans genes of this human pathogen in the near future.

  abstract = {Virulence of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans depends on the switch from budding to filamentous growth, which requires sustained membrane traffic and polarized growth. In many organisms, small GTPases of the Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) family regulate membrane/protein trafficking, yet little is known about their role in fungal filamentous growth. To investigate these GTPases in C. albicans, we generated loss of function mutants in all 3 Arf proteins, Arf1-Arf3, and 2 Arf-like proteins, Arl1 and Arl3. Our results indicate that of these proteins, Arf2 is required for viability and sensitivity to antifungal drugs. Repressible ARF2 expression results in defects in filamentous growth, cell wall integrity and virulence, likely due to alteration of the Golgi. Arl1 is also required for invasive filamentous growth and, although arl1/arl1 cells can initiate hyphal growth, hyphae are substantially shorter than that of the wild-type, due to the inability of this mutant to maintain hyphal growth at a single site. We show that this defect does not result from an alteration of phospholipid distribution and is unlikely to result from the sole Golgin Imh1 mislocalization, as Imh1 is not required for invasive filamentous growth. Rather, our results suggest that the arl1/arl1 hyphal growth defect results from increased secretion in this mutant. Strikingly, the arl1/arl1 mutant is drastically reduced in virulence during oropharyngeal candidiasis. Together, our results highlight the importance of Arl1 and Arf2 as key regulators of hyphal growth and virulence in C. albicans and identify a unique function of Arl1 in secretion.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Protein trafficking in the secretory pathway, for example the secretion of Wnt proteins, requires tight regulation. These ligands activate Wnt signaling pathways and are crucially involved in development and disease. Wnt is transported to the plasma membrane by its cargo receptor Evi, where Wnt/Evi complexes are endocytosed and sorted onto exosomes for long-range secretion. However, the trafficking steps within the endosomal compartment are not fully understood. The promiscuous SNARE Ykt6 folds into an auto-inhibiting conformation in the cytosol, but a portion associates with membranes by its farnesylated and palmitoylated C-terminus. Here, we demonstrate that membrane detachment of Ykt6 is essential for exosomal Wnt secretion. We identified conserved phosphorylation sites within the SNARE domain of Ykt6, which block Ykt6 cycling from the membrane to the cytosol. In \emph{Drosophila}, Ykt6 RNAi-mediated block of Wg secretion is rescued by wildtype but not phosphomimicking Ykt6. We show that phosphomimicking Ykt6 accumulates at membranes, while wildtype Ykt6 regulates Wnt trafficking between the plasma membrane and multivesicular bodies in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, we show that exosomal sorting of Wnts is fine-tuned by a regulatory switch in Ykt6 shifting it from a membrane-bound to cytosolic state at the level of endosomal maturation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, no Ypt/Rab GTPase has been shown to regulate the motility of exocytic compartments. In yeast, the Ypt31/32 functional pair is required for the formation of trans-Golgi vesicles. The myosin V motor Myo2 attaches to these vesicles through its globular-tail domain (GTD) and mediates their polarized delivery to sites of cell growth. Here, we identify Myo2 as an effector of Ypt31/32 and show that the Ypt31/32\textendash{}Myo2 interaction is required for polarized secretion. Using the yeast-two hybrid system and coprecipitation of recombinant proteins, we show that Ypt31/32 in their guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound form interact directly with Myo2-GTD. The physiological relevance of this interaction is shown by colocalization of the proteins, genetic interactions between their genes, and rescue of the lethality caused by a mutation in the Ypt31/32-binding site of Myo2-GTD through fusion with Ypt32. Furthermore, microscopic analyses show a defective Myo2 intracellular localization in ypt31{$\Delta$}/32ts and in Ypt31/32-interaction\textendash{}deficient myo2 mutant cells, as well as accumulation of unpolarized secretory vesicles in the latter mutant cells.

These GTPases apparently function during the targeting of vesicles to the acceptor compartment. Two members of the Ypt/rab family, Ypt1p and Sec4p, have been shown to regulate early and late steps of the yeast exocytic pathway, respectively. Here we tested the role of two newly identified GTPases, Ypt31p and Ypt32p. These two proteins share 81\% identity and 90\% similarity, and belong to the same protein subfamily as Ypt1p and Sec4p. Yeast cells can tolerate deletion of either the YPT31 or the YPT32 gene, but not both. These observations suggest that Ypt31p and Ypt32p perform identical or overlapping functions. Cells deleted for the YPT31 gene and carrying a conditional ypt32 mutation exhibit protein transport defects in the late exocytic pathway, but not in vacuolar protein sorting. The ypt31/ 32 mutant secretory defect is clearly downstream from that displayed by a ypt1 mutant and is similar to that of sec4 mutant cells. However, electron microscopy revealed that while sec4 mutant cells accumulate secretory vesicles, ypt31/32 mutant cells accumulate aberrant Golgi structures. The ypt31/32 phenotype is epistatic to that of a sec1 mutant, which accumulates secretory vesicles. Together, these results indicate that the Ypt31/32p GTPases are required for a step that occurs in the transGolgi compartment, between the reactions regulated by Ypt1p and Sec4p. This step might involve budding of vesicles from the trans-Golgi. Alternatively, Ypt31/ 32p might promote secretion indirectly, by allowing fusion of recycling vesicles with the trans-Golgi compartment.},

  volume = {8},
  issn = {1059-1524},
  abstract = {The protein trafficking machinery of eukaryotic cells is employed for protein secretion and for the localization of resident proteins of the exocytic and endocytic pathways. Protein transit between organelles is mediated by transport vesicles that bear integral membrane proteins (v-SNAREs) which selectively interact with similar proteins on the target membrane (t-SNAREs), resulting in a docked vesicle. A novelSaccharomyces cerevisiae SNARE protein, which has been termed Vti1p, was identified by its sequence similarity to known SNAREs. Vti1p is a predominantly Golgi-localized 25-kDa type II integral membrane protein that is essential for yeast viability. Vti1p can bind Sec17p (yeast SNAP) and enter into a Sec18p (NSF)-sensitive complex with the cis-Golgi t-SNARE Sed5p. This Sed5p/Vti1p complex is distinct from the previously described Sed5p/Sec22p anterograde vesicle docking complex. Depletion of Vti1p in vivo causes a defect in the transport of the vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y through the Golgi. Temperature-sensitive mutants of Vti1p show a similar carboxypeptidase Y trafficking defect, but the secretion of invertase and gp400/hsp150 is not significantly affected. The temperature-sensitive vti1 growth defect can be rescued by the overexpression of the v-SNARE, Ykt6p, which physically interacts with Vti1p. We propose that Vti1p, along with Ykt6p and perhaps Sft1p, acts as a retrograde v-SNARE capable of interacting with the cis-Golgi t-SNARE Sed5p.},

  abstract = {Vesicular transport between secretory compartments requires specific recognition molecules called SNAREs. Here we report the identification of three putative SNAREs, p14 (Sft1p), p28 (Gos1p), and a detailed characterization of p26 (Ykt6p). All three were originally isolated as interacting partners of the cis Golgi target membrane-associated SNARE Sed5p, when Sec18p (yeast NSF) was inactivated. YKT6 is an essential gene that codes for a novel vesicle-associated SNARE functioning at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi transport step in the yeast secretory pathway. Depletion of Ykt6p results in the accumulation of the p1 precursor (endoplasmic reticulum form) of the vacuolar enzyme carboxypeptidase Y and morphological abnormalities consistent with a defect in secretion. Membrane localization of Ykt6p is essential for protein function and is normally mediated by isoprenylation. However, replacement of the isoprenylation motif with a bona fide transmembrane anchor results in a functional protein confirming that membrane localization, but not isoprenylation per se, is required for function. Ykt6p and its homologues are highly conserved from yeast to human as demonstrated by the functional complementation of the loss of Ykt6p by its human counterpart. This is the first example of a human SNARE protein functionally replacing a yeast SNARE. This observation implies that the specific details of the vesicle targeting code, like the genetic code, are conserved in evolution.},

Ykt6p is a yeast R-SNARE  protein that has been implicated in retrograde transport to the  cis-Golgi compartment. Ykt6p has been also been found to fractionate  with vacuole membranes and participate in a vacuolar SNARE complex in  homotypic vacuole fusion. To investigate the role of Ykt6p in membrane traffic  to the vacuole we generated temperature-sensitive mutations in YKT6.  One mutation produces an early Golgi block to secretion, and overexpression of  the SNARE protein Sft1p suppresses the growth and secretion defects of this  mutation. These results are consistent with Ykt6p and Sft1p participating in a  SNARE complex associated with retrograde transport to the cis-Golgi.  A second set of mutations in YKT6 specifically affects post-Golgi  membrane traffic to the vacuole, and the effects of these mutations are not  suppressed by Sft1p overexpression. Defects are seen in carboxypeptidase Y  sorting, alkaline phosphatase transport, and aminopeptidase I delivery, and in  one mutant, overexpression of the SNARE protein Nyv1p suppresses the alkaline  phosphatase transport defect. By mutationally separating early and late  requirements for Ykt6p, our findings have revealed that Ykt6p is a R-SNARE  protein that functions directly in the three biosynthetic pathways to the  vacuole.},

Proteins interacting with TEM receptors cytoplasmic regions presented a considerable degree of overlap, although some highly specific CD81 tetraspanin ligands, such as Rac GTPase, were detected. Quantitative proteomics showed that TEM ligands account for a great proportion of the exosome proteome and that a selective repertoire of CD81-associated molecules, including Rac, is not correctly routed to exosomes in cells from CD81-deficient animals.

This proportion of CREs can potentially inform on the disease stage and enable non-invasive monitoring of inter-individual variations in tumor-receptor expression levels. Our approach utilises a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) platform to quantify the proportion of CREs in a two-step strategy that involves (i) initial isolation of bulk exosome population using tetraspanin biomarkers (i.e., CD9, CD63), and (ii) subsequent detection of CREs within the captured bulk exosomes using tumor-specific markers (e.g., human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)). We demonstrate the isolation of bulk exosome population and detection of as low as 10\% HER2(+) exosomes from samples containing designated proportions of HER2(+) BT474 and HER2(-) MDA-MB-231 cell derived exosomes.

However, its roles in Candida albicans, the leading fungal pathogen in human beings, remain to be detailed. Most recently, we found that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducing conditions led to transcriptional up-regulation of C. albicans autophagy-related (ATG) genes, implying a possible link between autophagy and ER stress response in this pathogen. Using a series of C. albicans ATG mutants and autophagy reporting systems, we found that both treatment of ER stress-related drugs and loss of the ER calcium pump Spf1 promoted autophagic flux of Atg8 and Lap41 (a homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ape1), indicating that these conditions induce autophagy. Moreover, deletion of ATG genes in the spf1{$\Delta$}/{$\Delta$} mutant rendered cells hypersensitive to these drugs and caused activation of UPR, revealing a role of autophagy in alleviating ER stress. In addition, only treatment of tunicamycin and loss of Spf1 in combination increased autophagic flux of the ER component Sec63, suggesting that most of the ER stress-related conditions cause non-selective autophagy rather than selective ER phagy. This study uncovers the important role of C. albicans autophagy in ER stress response and tolerance to antifungal drugs.},

Morphogenesis and alterations in cell shape require integration of many cellular functions and occur in response to environmental signals, most notably pH and temperature in the case of C. albicans. In the course of our studies of differential gene expression associated with dimorphism of C. albicans, we have isolated a gene, designated PHR1, which is regulated in response to the pH of the culture medium. PHR1 expression was repressed at pH values below 5.5 and induced at more alkaline pH. The predicted amino acid sequence of the PHR1 protein was 56\% identical to that of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ggp1/Gas1 protein, a highly glycosylated cell surface protein attached to the membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol. A homozygous null mutant of PHR1 was constructed and found to exhibit a pH-conditional morphological defect. At alkaline pH, the mutant, unlike the parental type, was unable to conduct apical growth of either yeast or hyphal growth forms. This morphological aberration was not associated with defective cytoskeletal polarization or secretion. The results suggest that PHR1 defines a novel function required for apical cell growth and morphogenesis.},

  title = {The Interaction with Fungal Cell Wall Polysaccharides Determines the Salt Tolerance of Antifungal Plant Defensins},
  volume = {5},
  issn = {2468-2330},
  abstract = {The fungal cell wall is the first point of contact between fungal pathogens and host organisms. It serves as a protective barrier against biotic and abiotic stresses and as a signal to the host that a fungal pathogen is present. The fungal cell wall is made predominantly of carbohydrates and glycoproteins, many of which serve as binding receptors for host defence molecules or activate host immune responses through interactions with membrane-bound receptors. Plant defensins are a large family of cationic antifungal peptides that protect plants against fungal disease. Binding of the plant defensin NaD1 to the fungal cell wall has been described but the specific component of the cell wall with which this interaction occurred was unknown. The effect of binding was also unclear, that is whether the plant defensin used fungal cell wall components as a recognition motif for the plant to identify potential pathogens or if the cell wall acted to protect the fungus against the defensin. Here we describe the interaction between the fungal cell wall polysaccharides chitin and {$\beta$}-glucan with NaD1 and other plant defensins. We discovered that the {$\beta$}-glucan layer protects the fungus against plant defensins and the loss of activity experienced by many cationic antifungal peptides at elevated salt concentrations is due to sequestration by fungal cell wall polysaccharides. This has limited the development of cationic antifungal peptides for the treatment of systemic fungal diseases in humans as the level of salt in serum is enough to inactivate most cationic peptides.},

In this study we applied various yeast transformation techniques to C. albicans and selected an electroporation procedure for further optimization. Transformation efficiencies of up to 300 transformants/{$\mathrm{\mu}$}g were obtained for an integrative plasmid and up to 4500 transformants/{$\mathrm{\mu}$}g for a CARS-carrying plasmid. This reasonably high transformation efficiency, combined with the ease and speed of electroporation in comparison to alternative techniques, make it the preferred method for transformation of C. albicans.

  issn = {1097-0061},
  abstract = {A highly efficient method for transformation of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by electroporation has been developed. Significantly higher transformation efficiency was obtained when intact cells grown in SD medium (0.67\% Bacto yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2\% glucose) were pretreated with thiol compounds before an electric pulse was applied to the cells. Among the thiol compounds tested, dithiothreitol (DTT) was the most effective for pretreatment. A high transformation efficiency was obtained when the cells were pretreated with 25 mM DTT at 30\textdegree{}C for 15 min in an osmotically adjusted buffer, since the cells were sensitive to osmotic pressure. It was important to exclude glucose from the DTT pretreatment buffer, as it caused a drastic decrease in efficiency. The optimal cell concentration and amount of DNA during the electric pulse were 1\texttimes{}109 cells/ml and 10 ng, respectively. The maximum transformation efficiency, 1.2\texttimes{}107 transformants/{$\mathrm{\mu}$}g plasmid DNA, was obtained when an electric pulse of 11.0 kV/cm was applied for 5 ms. Furthermore, the high competency of cells pretreated with DTT was maintained by freezing them in a non-permeating cryoprotectant such as sorbitol.

Deduced amino acid sequence showed strong homologies (59\textendash{}85\% identity) with OMP DCases of different Saccharomycetales and allowed identification of the known conserved domains. Very close upstream from the URA3 gene, the 3{${'}$}-end of a gene encoding a Gea2-like protein was identified. A non-revertible C. lusitaniae ura3 mutant was selected on the basis of 5-fluoroorotic acid resistance. The mutation was a single point mutation resulting in the amino acid substitution D95V in a highly conserved domain, and in a concomitant EcoRV restriction site polymorphism. The mutant strain was successfully transformed to prototrophy following electroporation with the URA3 gene cloned in an integrative vector, with frequencies of 100\textendash{}200 transformants per {$\mathrm{\mu}$}g of DNA. Southern blot analysis revealed that almost all transformants were derived from homologous recombination events at the resident locus.

Current techniques to study exosome physiology are based on isolation procedures after secretion, precluding direct and dynamic insight into the mechanics of exosome biogenesis and the regulation of their release. In this study, we propose real-time visualization of MVB\textendash{}PM fusion to overcome these limitations. We designed tetraspanin-based pH-sensitive optical reporters that detect MVB\textendash{}PM fusion using live total internal reflection fluorescence and dynamic correlative light\textendash{}electron microscopy. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that MVB\textendash{}PM fusion frequency is reduced by depleting the target membrane SNAREs SNAP23 and syntaxin-4 but also can be induced in single cells by stimulation of the histamine H1 receptor (H1HR). Interestingly, activation of H1R1 in HeLa cells increases Ser110 phosphorylation of SNAP23, promoting MVB\textendash{}PM fusion and the release of CD63-enriched exosomes. Using this single-cell resolution approach, we highlight the modulatory dynamics of MVB exocytosis that will help to increase our understanding of exosome physiology and identify druggable targets in exosome-associated pathologies.},

  title = {Exosomes from Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells Can Transfer Phenotypic Traits Representing Their Cells of Origin to Secondary Cells},
  volume = {49},
  issn = {0959-8049},
  abstract = {Background
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15\textendash{}20\% of breast cancers but is responsible for a disproportionate number of deaths. We investigated the relevance, in TNBC, of nano-sized exosomes expelled from cells. Specifically, we compared effects of exosomes derived from the claudin-low TNBC cell line Hs578T and its more invasive Hs578Ts(i)8 variant, as well as exosomes from TNBC patient sera compared to normal sera.
Methods
Exosomes were isolated from conditioned media (CM) of Hs578T and Hs578Ts(i)8 cells and from sera by filtration and ultracentrifugation. Successful isolation was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and immunoblotting. Subsequent analysis, of secondary/recipient cells in response to exosomes, included proliferation; motility/migration; invasion; anoikis assays and endothelial tubule formation assays.
Results
Hs578Ts(i)8-exosomes versus Hs578T-exosomes significantly increased the proliferation, migration and invasion capacity of all three recipient cell lines evaluated i.e. SKBR3, MDA-MB-231 and HCC1954. Exosomes from Hs578Ts(i)8 cells also conferred increased invasiveness to parent Hs578T cells. Hs578Ts(i)8-exosomes increased sensitivity of SKBR3, MDA-MB-231 and HCC1954 to anoikis when compared to the effects of Hs578T-exosomes reflecting the fact that Hs578Ts(i)8 cells are themselves innately more sensitive to anoikis. In relation to vasculogenesis and subsequent angiogenesis, Hs578Ts(i)8-exosomes versus Hs578T-exosomes stimulated significantly more endothelial tubules formation. Finally, our pilot translational study showed that exosomes from TNBC patients' sera significantly increased recipient cells' invasion when compared to those derived from age- and gender-matched healthy control sera.
Conclusion
This study supports the hypothesis that TNBC exosomes may be involved in cancer cell-to-cell communication, conferring phenotypic traits to secondary cells that reflect those of their cells of origin.},

  abstract = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication that carry protein, lipids, and nucleic acids via the circulation to target cells whereupon they mediate physiological changes. In pregnancy, EVs are released in high quantities from the placenta and have been postulated to target multiple cell types, including those of the vascular and immune systems. However, most studies of pregnancy-associated EVs have used clinical samples and in vitro models; to date, few studies have taken advantage of murine models in which pregnancy can be precisely timed and manipulated. In this study, we used a murine model to determine whether the quantity of EVs is altered during healthy pregnancy and during inflammation-associated preterm birth. To facilitate data analysis, we developed a novel software package, tidyNano, an R package that provides functions to import, clean, and quickly summarize raw data generated by the nanoparticle tracking device, NanoSight (Malvern Panalytical). We also developed shinySIGHT, a Shiny web application that allows for interactive exploration and visualization of EV data. In mice, EV concentration in blood increased linearly across pregnancy, with significant rises at GD14.5 and 17.5 relative to EV concentrations in nonpregnant females. Additionally, lipopolysaccharide treatment resulted in a significant reduction in circulating EV concentrations relative to vehicle-treated controls at GD16.5 within 4 hours. Use of tidyNano facilitated rapid analysis of EV data; importantly, this package provides a straightforward framework by which diverse types of large datasets can be simply and efficiently analyzed, is freely available under the MIT license, and is hosted on GitHub (https://nguyens7.github.io/tidyNano/). Our data highlight the utility of the mouse as a model of EV biology in pregnancy, and suggest that placental dysfunction is associated with reduced circulating EVs.},
