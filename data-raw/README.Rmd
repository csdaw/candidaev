# /data-raw

## description
This directory contains all of the raw data files used in this project. These files are
*not* included when the package is installed using `devtools::install_github()`. Rather 
*'clean'* versions of the `.csv` and `.tab` files are provided in the [`/data`](../data) 
folder as `.rda` files which are accessible once the package has been installed and 
loaded or attached.

To access these raw files:

1. Right click on a desired file and select `Save link as...`.

2. Copy the url for the desired directory, paste into 
[DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home), then download as a `.zip`.

3. Download this entire repository as a `.zip` from this URL: 
<https://github.com/csdaw/candidaev/archive/master.zip>

4. Clone this repository.
