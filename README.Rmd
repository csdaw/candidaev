Bleackley, M. R. (2019) Sur7 family proteins are putative markers for
_Candida albicans_ extracellular vesicles. Mol. Cell. Proteomics, submitted.

It has been permanently archived at Zenodo with the DOI shown above.

The compendium includes all the data, code, and text associated with the 
publication. It is structured as an R package to facilitate reproducilibity and 
distribution. The principles and motivations behind using research compendiums 
for academic research is detailed in 
[Marwick et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986). 

The R package [rrtools](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) was used in the 
production of this compendium.
